Cytogenetic research in Medicago sativa subsp. sativa L., the cultivated tetraploid alfalfa (2n = 4x = 32), has lagged behind other crops mostly due to the small size and the uniform morphology of its chromosomes. However, in the last decades, the development of molecular cytogenetic techniques based on in situ hybridization has largely contributed to overcoming these limitations. The purpose of this study was to extend our knowledge about the chromosome structure of alfalfa by using a combination of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. The results of self-GISH (sGISH) suggested that a substantial part of the repetitive fraction of the genome of subsp. sativa is constituted by tandem repeats typical of satellite DNA. The coincidence of sGISH and C-banding patterns supported this assumption. The FISH mapping of the Arabidopsis-type TTTAGGG telomeric repeats demonstrated, for the first time, that the alfalfa telomeres consist of this type of sequence and revealed a massive presence of interstitial telomeric repeats (ITRs).

The geographic and taxonomic distribution of polyploids suggests that polyploidy arose many times in the taxa of Sphaeralcea. Sphaeralcea fendleri var. venusta, S. polychroma, and S. wrightii populations have yielded exclusively tetraploid counts. Tetraploidy is correlated with taxa having lavender petals. Polyploidy has also allowed the taxa to expand their distributions without resulting in speciation. SPHAERALCEA WAS LAST revised by Keamey (1935) to include over 50 taxa.

('sorghum', "Early-generation germplasm introgression from Sorghum macrospermum into sorghum (S. bicolor). Sorghum has been improved by public and private breeding programs utilizing germplasm mostly from within the species Sorghum bicolor. Recently, hybridization with an Australian species, S. macrospermum (AAB1B1YYZZ), has been demonstrated and the genomic relationship to S. bicolor (AAB1B1) shown to be partially compatible. For this species to be potentially useful to sorghum improvement programs, there must be documented introgression into an S. bicolor background. Fifteen BC1F1 progeny were recovered using the interspecific hybrid as a female and embryo rescue. In these progeny, chromosome numbers ranged from 35 to 70 and all were essentially male-sterile. Repeated backcrossing with S. bicolor pollen produced BC2F1 seed on 3 of the 15 BC1F1 plants. BC2F1 progeny had varying levels of male fertility; selfed seed set ranged from 0% to 95%, with only 2 individuals being completely male-sterile. Using AFLP and SSR markers, genomic introgression of S. macrospermum ranged from 0% to 18.6%. Cytogenetic analysis of 19 individuals revealed that chromosome numbers were 20, except for a single backcross that had 21 chromosomes. Molecular cytogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of recombinant introgression chromosomes as well as alien addition and alien substitution chromosomes within the BC2F1s.

I've also attached the document in case you can change it. (Karper and Chisholm, 1936; Ayyanger and Ponnaiya, 1941; Garber, 1950; Endrizzi, 1957; Tang and Liang, 1988; Wu, 1990; Sun et al., 1991; Huelgas et al., 1996) . The cause of reproductive isolation between sorghum and the tertiary gene pool was unknown until Hodnett et al., (2005) S. macrospermum (2n = 40) is the only member of the Chaetosorghum section and it is native to the Katherine area in the Northern Territory of Australia (Lazarides et al., 1991) . While this species does not possess any obvious agronomically desirable traits, it does have significant pest resistance. It is either a non-host or has ovipositional non-preference to sorghum midge (Stenodiplosis sorghicola Coquillett) (Franzmann and Hardy, 1996; Sharma and Franzmann, 2001 ). It is not susceptible to sorghum downy mildew (Peronosclerospora sorghi Weston and Uppal (Shaw)) (Kamala et al., 2002) and has high tolerance to shoot fly (Atherigona soccata Rond.) (Sharma et al., 2005) . These beneficial traits, as well as the possibility that it holds other valuable unique genetic variation, make it attractive to use in an introgression breeding program. Until recently, the genomic relationship between S. macrospermum and S. bicolor was not known. Several authors have described S. bicolor (2n = 4x = 20; AAB 1 B 1 ) has an ancient tetraploid; its genomic formula was derived by analyzing meiosis in hybrids with S. halepense (2n = 8x = 40; AAAAB 1 B 1 B 2 B 2 ) (Hadley, 1953; Celerier, 1958; Tang and Liang, 1988) . Meiotic chromosome pairing behavior in interspecific hybrids between S. bicolor and S. macrospermum revealed that moderate levels of allosyndetic recombination occurred and the genomic formula AAB 1 B 1 YYZZ was proposed for S. macrospermum (2n = 8x = 40) (Kuhlman et al., 2008) . Allosyndetic recombination was observed in subgenomes A and B 1 , but the frequency was 2.5 times higher in subgenome A. The authors attempted to produce backcrosses using the interspecific hybrid as a male, but were not successful. The tertiary gene pool species S. macrospermum is now available to plant breeders because hybrids can now be recovered by using specific S. bicolor germplasm (iap iap). The sorghum and wild species genomes undergo moderate levels of allosyndetic recombination; therefore, recovering introgression in backcross progeny is likely (Kuhlman et al. 2008) . The remaining obstacle to using this species in an introgression program is determining how to recover backcrosses. The objectives of this . determined that it was due to pollen-pistil incompatibilities. Pollen tube growth of wild species was inhibited in the stigma and style which prevented successful fertilization. The reproductive barriers proved to be strong but not complete as Price et al., (2005) finally recovered one interspecific hybrid between cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) sorghum and S. macrospermum. The efficiency of producing this hybrid improved dramatically by using a S. bicolor genotype homozygous for the iap allele. The Iap locus (Inhibition of Alien Pollen) controls a pistil barrier that prevents foreign species pollen tube growth; whereas, the recessive genotype (iap iap) allows pollen tube growth of maize as well as wild sorghum species (Laurieand Bennett, 1989; Price et al., 2006).Price et al., (2006)  recovered hybrids between sorghum and S. macrospermum, S. nitidum, and S. angustum but only hybrids with S. macrospermum survived to maturity. gene pool was completely inaccessible as no hybrids had ever been recovered despite numerous efforts"), [{'full_name_matches': {'sorghum bicolor', 'sorghum macrospermum'}, 'sent_text': 'The cause of reproductive isolation between sorghum and the tertiary gene pool was unknown until Hodnett et al., (2005) S. macrospermum (2n = 40) is the only member of the Chaetosorghum section and it is native to the Katherine area in the Northern Territory of Australia (Lazarides et al., 1991) .'}]

Pierre de Tchihatcheff (with Tschikatcheff, Tschihatcheff as orthographic variants) was born in Russia of Bohemian descent as Petr AleksandrovicˇChikhaceff. He lived from 1812 to 1890. After ceasing diplomatic duties in 1844 he lived in Paris from where he set forth on his various trips. He travelled as a geographer and botanist in the Altai, Asia minor, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Spain. From a note in Ö sterr. Bot. Zeitschrift 8: 408 (1858) we learn he returned to Paris after making several trips to Asia minor (present-day Turkey) during 1848-1858. It is stated in Bull. Soc. Bot. France 16: 357 (1869) that the plants collected from his travels were donated to the herbarium of the Socie´te´botanique de France and through the society, later to P (50 ''paquets''). There is also extant material at G, LE and W. The above information was compiled from Stafleu and Cowan (1986) and Vegter (1988) . In 1860 Tchihatcheff published the botanical part of his travels in Turkey with the title ''Asie Mineure. Part 3: Botanique (2 vols): É le´ments d'une flore de l'Asie Mineure, de l'Arme´nie et des ıˆles de l'archipel grec.'' (to be cited later as Asie min., Bot.) together with an Atlas. Davis and Edmondson (1979) had referred to the work as unreliable, meaning that the localities of some of the plants listed were found to be incorrect. Tchihatcheff's itinerary has been reconstructed by Kiepert (1867) and published separately as ''P. v. Tschihatcheff's Reisen in Kleinasien und Armenia 1847-1863''. Tchihatcheff is immortalized by Neotchihatchewia Rauschert in the Brassicaceae, ''a monotypic genus of doubtful affinity'' as well as by several other species bearing his name, some of them rather remarkable (Tchihatchewia Boissier maintained as distinct genus for which new name Neotchihatchewia Rauschert was proposed, cf. Tchihatchewia Unger, Tschichatschevia Vologdin). The aim of this paper is not to provide an account of Tchihatcheff's travels and botanical activities in Pl. Syst.

Meyer, a sun-loving steppic annual occurring also as a segetal in cultivated fields and field margins, reported to be threatened with extinction, numbering 1-2 million in the year 1999 and dwindling to only 85 individuals the next year and making a remarkable recovery in 2005 (see Bos¸gelmez 2005) . The cause of the registered decline was attributed to changes in arable habitat and excessive use of herbicides and not with the usual periodic fluctuations in numbers frequently observed in most weeds from year to year. Studies on the conservation biology of the species are currently in progress supported by TÜ B _ ITAK (Vural et al. 2004 (Vural et al. -2007 . The flowers are most attractive as the pale or dark pinkish-red marginal florets (the most frequent colour form) take on an iridescent shimmer in the sun and wind, hence the vernacular name 'Yanardoner', meaning 'iridescent flower'. It flowers from late April to mid-June and in cultivation even earlier, e.g., March in Istanbul. The peak flowering period is mid-May and in earlier years it was sold in some quantity by street florists in Ankara. It is mainly bee-, bug-and beetle-pollinated. Ants play an important role in seed dispersal and the fully ripe fat achenes are a delight for pigeons which settle down to feed in large flocks (Fig. 2) . The species is of taxonomic interest as it has some rather unusual and unique features not existing in any other Centaurea. For example, the marginal florets are funnel-shaped with crenate margins. The anther-tube is provided with glands at the tips of the appendages (Fig. 1) . Boissier (1875) established it as belonging to the genus Melanoloma Cass., proposing the combination Melanoloma tchihatchewi (Fischer & C.A. Meyer) Boiss. However, the type species of Melanoloma is Centaurea pullata which has no affinities at all with C. tchihatcheffii. The species was placed in Centaurea sect. Cyanus (Mill.) W.D.J. Koch by Wagenitz (1975) . Three annual members of this section with which C. tchihatcheffii has a superficial resemblance are C. cyanus L., the nomenclatural type, with the chromosome number of 2n = 24 (x = 12), C. cyanoides Wahlenb. with 2n = 18 (x = 9) and C. depressa M.

('robusta', "Exceedingly high chromosome number in Strasburgeriaceae, a monotypic family endemic to New Caledonia . We present the first report on the chromosome number of Strasburgeria robusta, which is confined to montane forests of New Caledonia and is the only known species in Strasburgeriaceae. The species has 2n = 500, which is an exceedingly high chromosome number in angiosperms. Within Crossosomatales, molecular evidence has indicated that S. robusta is sister to Ixerba brexioides, which is endemic to New Zealand and is the sole species in Ixerbaceae. Comparisons to the chromosome number of I. brexioides (2n = 50) support a close affinity between the two species because they share the base number x = 25. It is generally accepted that an increase in ploidy is associated with the origin of novel adaptations. A high level of polyploidy (20x with x = 25) may have allowed S. robusta to survive on a fragment of Gondwana by adapting to its ultrabasic substrate. Strasburgeria robusta, the only species in the family Strasburgeriaceae, is a 3 to 15 m tall tree ( Fig. 1A) , which grows at elevations of 300-1200 m in New Caledonia. It occurs only on ultrabasic substrate (Morat et al. 1986) in the southern area of the main island, Grande-Terre, mainly in Nothofagus and Araucaria humid forests. Strasburgeria was first described by Baillon (1876) as an enigmatic genus in the family Clusiaceae and was later most often placed in Ochnaceae or in its own family near Ochnaceae (for a taxonomic history see Dickison 1981 , Cameron 2003 , Matthews and Endress 2005 . However, Amaral (1991) , who conducted a cladistic analysis of Ochnaceae, showed that Strasburgeria has no synapomorphies with Ochnaceae. Although the close relatives of Strasburgeria have long been uncertain, recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that S. robusta is sister to Ixerba brexioides A. Cunn., the sole species of Ixerbaceae, endemic to New Zealand (Savolainen et al. 2000 , Sosa and Chase 2003 , Cameron 2003 , and should be classified as a distinct family in Crossosomatales (Matthews and Endress 2005) . The flowers of Strasburgeria are large and bisexual with a superior ovary (Fig. 1B) . The vegetative and floral morphology have been well studied (e.g. Dickison 1981, Matthews and Endress 2005) . Cameron (2003) enumer-ated similarities in wood anatomical characters between Strasburgeroa and Ixerba, particularly in the morphology of the vessel elements. Matthews and Endress (2005, p. 37 ) showed a number of exclusive floral structural features that are shared between Strasburgeria and Ixerba, including (1) large flowers compared to other Crossosomatales, (2) petals long in bud and forming a tight pointed cone, (3) stamens with long filaments and sagittate anthers, (4) a pentamerous gynoecium, (5) the conical gynoecium with a streamlined transition from ovary to style, and (6) antitropous ovules. In this paper, we present the chromosome number of S. robusta. Ixerba brexioides has a count of 2n = 50 (Hair and Beuzenberg 1966) , whereas the chromosome count of Strasburgeria has not previously been reported. Chromosome data may provide additional information to better understand the evolutionary position of S. robusta. We investigated an individual specimen of Strasburgeria robusta (Vieill. ex Panch. & Seb.) Guillaumin growing at an elevation of 700 m on Mt. Fig. 1C ). The flower bud was broken into pieces using forceps, and the pieces were pre-treated in a vial with 0.002 M 8-hydroxyquinoline for ca. 6 hours at 18°C. The pieces were then fixed with acetic acid and ethanol (1:3) at 5°C and kept in a freezer ()20°C) for more than 24 hours. The fixed materials were stained and macerated with a 10:1 mixture of 2% aceto-orcein and 1 N HCl for 20-30 minutes at room temperature and were squashed on a glass slide. The chromosome number of S. robusta is 2n = 500 ( Fig. 2A, B) . The chromosomes are small, and range in size from 0.3 $ 1.3 lm. To our knowledge 2n = 500 is an exceedingly high chromosome number in angiosperms, though higher chromosome numbers are known from Sedum suaveolens Kimnach (n = ca. 320) of Crassulaceae (Uhl 1978) and Voaniola gerardii J. Dransf. (2n = 596) of Arecaceae (Johnson 1989 . Chromosome information available for other families in Crossosomatales shows that n = 13 and 2n = 26 are common in Staphyleaceae, 2n = 24 in Stachyuraceae and Crossosomataceae, and 2n = 50 in Ixerbaceae (for chromosome data of individual families see ''Chromosome numbers of flowering plants'' edited by Fedorov [1974] and the ''Index to plant chromosome numbers'' edited by Ornduff [1967 Ornduff [ -1968 , Moore [1973 Moore [ -1977 , Goldblatt [1981 Goldblatt [ -1988 , and Goldblatt and Johnson [1990-2003] ). The chromosome number of S. robusta is unusually large within its order. Figure 3 shows a phylogenetic tree of Crossosomatales based on Stevens (2005) . Within Crossosomatales, Strasburgeria and Ixerba are sister to each other and form a clade with Geissoloma (the only genus in Geissolomataceae), which is endemic to South Africa, and Aphloia (the only genus in Aphloiaceae), which occurs in Africa and Madagascar. The chromosome numbers of Geissoloma and Aphloia are unknown. Although its original number is uncertain, I. brexioides with 2n = 50 may be polyploid because the other taxa in Crossosomatales have x = 12, 13. Given that x = 25 is their common base number, the 2n = 500 of Strasburgeria is interpreted to be 20x, with x = 25. The shared base number x = 25 supports the close relationship between Ixerba and Strasburgeria (Fig. 3) . It is generally accepted that an increase in ploidy level is associated with the origin of novel adaptations (Levin 2002) . Polyploidy may induce subtle physiological differences that affect optimum growth and competition in extreme habitats. Consequently, polyploids may eventually come to occupy somewhat different habitats from their diploid ancestors, or they might occupy a different geographic range (Cronquist 1988 ). The extremely high ploidy level may have allowed Strasburgeria to extend its ancestral distribution and to adapt to the ultrabasic substrate in the montane forests of New Caledonia. High ploidy also tends to result in an increase of organ size; Matthews and Endress (2005, p. 37 ) noted: ''Strasburgeria flowers give the impression of a giant version of Ixerba flowers with some features more exaggerated.' ' Jarzen and Pocknall (1993) discussed the close affinity between Strasburgeria pollen and fossil pollen of Bluffopollis scabratus from the Tertiary of New Zealand, suggesting their common origin in the New Caledonian -New Zealand flora. New Caledonia and New Zealand are thought to have separated from Australia as fragments of the eastern margin of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous (Raven and Axelrod 1972) . For a long time, the relationships of Strasburgeria could not be determined based on morphological characters alone (for review see Cameron 2003 ). This may have been because Strasburgeria had lost its relatives at lower ploidy levels early in its evolutionary history; however, the extant species survives as an extreme relict on a fragment of Gondwana.

('bulbosum', 'Cytological studies on a polyhaploid ofCritesion iranicum obtained after hybridization withC. bulbosum . One polyhaploid (2n=3x=21) ofCritesion iranicum (von Bothmer) A. Löve (6x=42) was obtained following interspecific hybridization with tetraploidC. bulbosum (L.) A. Löve, presumably through chromosome elimination. Meiotic pairing in pollen mother cells averaged 2.43 univalents, 0.12 rod bivalents, 2.37 ring bivalents, and 4.53 trivalents. The data indicate that the three genomes fromC. iranicum are homologous with equal affinity. This confirms thatC. iranicum is an autohexaploid. Critesion iranicum (yon Bothmer) A. l_6ve (L6ve, 1984) is a hexaploid species that has been named Hordeum brevisubulatum spp. iranicum Bothmer and hexaploid H. violaceum Boiss. & Huet by others (yon Bothmer, 1979; Dewey, 1979) . Based on results from meiotic analyses, Dewey (1979) concluded that it was an autohexaploid. However, Linde-Laursen et al. (1980) and Jorgensen (1986) could not determine conclusively the nature of polyploidy in this species based on the Giemsa C-banding of chromosomes and electrophoretic patterns of certain proteins, respectively. Chromosome elimination following interspecific or intergeneric hybridization involving species in the genus Hordeum has been reported for many combinations (Fedak, 1985; yon Bothmer et aL, 1984) . Critesion bulbosum (L.) A. L6ve (=Hordeum bulbosum L.) is being used in many breeding programs to obtain haploid 1-1. vulgare L., the cultivated barley, as well as polyhaploid Triticum aestivum L., the bread wheat. Subrahmanyam and yon Bothmer (1987) obtained di-and tri-haploids in the crosses of tetraploid and hexaploid H. brevisubulatum with H. bulbosum, respectively. They concluded that chromosome elimination was involved and that bulbosum genomes were eliminated from these hybrid combinations. Meiotic behaviors in their haploids were not reported, however. Alonso and Kimber (1981) developed methods to determine the relative affinity among the genomes in triploids. These types of numerical analyses of meiosis can be carried out with materials up to the pentaploid level Espinasse & Kimber, 1981) . To obtain polyhaploids of C. iranicum for numerical meiotic analysis, the hexaploid species was crossed with tetraploid C. bulbosum. This paper reports and inteprets meiosis in one such triploid. Three accessions of C. iranicum, PI 229448, PI 401379, and P1401380, were used in reciprocal cross-es with four accessions of tetraploid C. bulbosum. All parental materials were field grown mature plants. Spikes of the female parents were enclosed in parchment paper bags before anthesis. At anthesis, spikes of male parents were collectively inserted into the bags and shaken to pollinate unemasculated spikes. About 30 days later, spikes were threshed and only shrivelled seeds were cultured on orchid agar medium. Seedlings were transferred into pots and grown to mature plants in a greenhouse. Mitotic and meiotic chromosome preparations followed the same procedures as previously reported (Wang, 1985) . Meiotic data were analyzed by Dr. G. Kimber of the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, with the numerical equations for triploids . From crosses using the three accessions of C. iranicure as female parent, 97 shrivelled seeds were cultured, q-~,venty-five of them germinated but only 10 plants resulted. Due to abnormal development, many seedlings died. Nine of the ten plants had 41 to 43 chromosomes, thus they were considered to be progenies of self-pollination. The remaining one had 21 chromosomes so that it was presumed to be the polyhaploid of C. iranicum. Six shrivelled seeds from the reciprocal cross did not give rise to any plant even though one seed germinated in the test tube. Subrahmanyan and Von Bothmer (1987) also found that both diploid and tetraploid H. bulbosum were poor female parents in several attempts, in which no plants resulted. The cross in the present study and its reciprocal produced varying amounts of plump seeds, some of which were cultured and found to be all selfing progeny. The high frequency of self-pollination progeny from shrivelled seeds also indicated that the two polyploid species were self-fertile. The female parent must be emasculated to increase the chance of hybridization between C. iranicum and C. bulbosum. This conclusion is supported by the higher rate of haploid production, 4 plants out of 29 embryo cultured, in the cross where emassculation was practiced (Subrahmanyam & Von Bothmer, 1987) . One polyhaploid was derived from the cross between C. iranicum (6x=42, P1401379) and C. bulbosum (4x=28, PI 343189) after embryo rescue. None of the mitotic chromosome counts in root-tip cells was higher than 21 ( Fig. 1) . When the tetraploid C. brevisubulatum (Trin.) A. L6ve [=Hordeum brevisubulatum (Trin.) Link] was crossed with either diploid or tetraploid C. bulbosum it gave rise to haploids by eliminating the C. bulbosum chromosomes (Subrahmanyam, 1979; Jacobsen & Von Bothmer, 1981) . Chromosome elimination also occurred in the present hybrid between hexaploid C. iranicum and tetraploid C. bulbosum. This would suggest that both tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes of the C. brevisubulatum complex can eliminate C. bulbosum chromosomes. Subrahmanyam and Von Bothmer (1987) concluded that up to two bulbosum genomes could be eliminated by the brevisubulatum genomes. However, the chromosomes of C. brevisubulatum and C. iranicum were eliminated when these species were crossed with C.parodii (Covas) A. L6ve (4x=28), C. secalinum (Schreber) A. L6ve (4x=28), or C. procerum (Nevski) A. Lfve (6x=42) (Jacobsen & Von Bothmer, 1981) . Meiosis in pollen mother cells of the polyhaploid C. iranicum revealed a mean metaphase-I pairing configuration of 2.43 I + 0.12 rod II + 2.37 ring II + 4.53 III, which gave a c=0.994 (Table I) . Of the 93 cells analyzed, 22 had four trivalents and six had seven trivalents (Fig. 2) . All the ceils contained at least one trivalent. Results of the analysis by the methods of Alonso and Kimber (1981) indicate that the three genomes in the polyhaploid are homolo- Fig. 1 .

Therefore, C. iranicum must be an autopolyploid. This study and that of Dewey (1979) and Land-str6m et al. (1984) assessed the genome relationships on the basis of chromosome association at metaphase I; all concluded that C. iranicum is of autoploid nature. Others have used C-banding and electrophoresis of proteins (Linde-Laursen et al., 1980; Jorgensen, 1986 ) without a conclusive determinations of the nature of polyploidy. Comparing various methods of studying evolutionary relationships, Kimber (1984) concluded that chromosome pairing is more suitable for genome analysis than chromosome banding and protein electrophoresis because the genomic DNA as a whole is assessed by the former method. Differences in banding patterns of chromosomes or proteins provide evidence for genotypic variations, especially in outbreeding species, but they are not necessarily an indication of homology differences. The polymorphism in C-band was recognized by Linde-Laursen et ai. (1980) so that they acknowledged the minor importance of Cbanding in studying chromosome homology. Furthermore, Von Bothmer and Jacobsen (1986) observed a high fertility in hybrid combinations involving the hexaploid cytotype of H. brevisubulatum (= C. iranicum), and attributed it to the autoploid nature of this species. Therefore, the majority of studies supported the conclusion that C. iranicum is an autohexaploid.

The specific epithet 'albonervius' refers to the white nerves of leaves in the new species. Phenology. Flowering April; fruiting May to June. Distribution and habitat. Sinosenecio albonervius is currently known from two populations in the Hupingshan Natural Reserve, one on the northern slope within Hubei Province and the other on the southern slope within Hunan Province, China (Figure 3 ), growing in shady places along streamside at altitudes between 800-1,200 m above the sea level. Floral micromorphological characters. For observation of the anther endothecial cell wall thickenings and filament collar of Sinosenecio albonervius, heads were boiled in distilled water for 3 min, and then fixed with Carnoy I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol = 1:3). Mature disc florets removed from the fixed heads were dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 30 min and then in 99% ethanol for 1 h before they were treated with 5% NaOH overnight. The anther tissue was isolated from the florets on the slide, flooded with 50% glycerol and a cover slip was applied. Samples were then examined at 200× (filament collar) and 400× (endothecial cell wall thickenings) magnification by light microscopy and photographed. As shown in Figure 4A , the anther endothecial cell wall thickenings of Sinosenecio albonervius were polarized and radial, with the cells of polarized thickenings being predominant, conforming to the results reported previously for some other species of Sinosenecio, such as S. jishouensis D. G. Zhang, Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang (Zhang et al., 2008) , S. baojingensis Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang (Liu et al., 2009) and S. hupingshanensis Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang (Liu et al., 2010) . Sinosenecio palmatisectus had also the same pattern of anther endothecial cell wall thickenings (Liu and Yang, 2011b) as S. albonervius. The filament collar of S. albonervius consisted of uniformly sized cells ( Figure  4B ), which is one of the diagnostic features of the genus (Nordenstam, 1978; Jeffrey and Chen, 1984) . Chromosome cytology. For chromosome observation, root tips were pretreated with 0.1% colchicine for 2 h before being fixed in Carnoy I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol = 1:3), then macerated in a 1:1 mixture of 45% acetic acid and 1 M HCl at 60°C for 3 min, stained and squashed in Carbol fuchsin. One population (Houhe Exped. 080428057, JIU) of Sinosenecio albonervius was cytologically studied. In the interphase nucleus, a few darkly stained condensed bodies were observed, but their boundaries were not clear, because the other part was also stained fairly well but unevenly ( Figure 5A ). The prophase chromosomes displayed a continuous condensation pattern ( Figure 5B ). The metaphase chromosomes were counted as 2n = 48 ( Figure 5C ). The chromosome number of its putative close relative, S. palmatisectus, is also 2n = 48 (Liu and Yang, 2011a) . Ac- cording to the nomenclature of chromosomes of Levan et al. (1964) , S. albonervius had 42 median-centromeric (m), 2 submedian-centromeric (sm) and 4 subterminal-centromeric (st) chromosomes ( Figure 5D ), i.e. 2n = 48 = 42m + 2sm + 4st. Notes. Although Sinosenecio albonervius may be confused with S. palmatisectus ( Figure 6 ) owing to their similarities in posture, palmately-divided leaf-lamina and epappose achenes (Table 1) , it differs from the latter in that the leaf-lamina is shallowly 7-9-palmatilobed to 1/4- 1/3 (vs. deeply 7-9-palmatifid to the middle), matte-green above (vs. nitid-green), pubescent (vs. at first sparsely pubescent, later glabrescent), white veined (vs. yellowishgreen veined ), the lobes deltoid, margin remotely denticulate (vs. oblong-lanceolate, margin dentate or lobulate) and the ray florets 9-13 (vs. 12-16) (Table 1) . Undoubtedly, these two species are closely related as demonstrated by their gross morphology, floral micromorphology as well as chromosome number. Western Hunan and western Hubei in south-central China are remarkably mountainous and are well known biodiversity hotspots. The recent discovery of four new species of Sinosenecio there (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; this paper) indicates that these two regions are far from being well botanized, particularly for a genus like Sinosenecio which is distinguished for the narrow endemism of many of its species (Jeffrey and Chen, 1984; Liu et al., 2011) .  .

('fragilis', 'Genome relationship betweenPsathyrostachys huashanica andP. fragilis (Poaceae) . Hybrids between the Chinese endemic speciesPsathyrostachys huashanicaKeng and the SW. Asian speciesP. fragilis (Boiss.)Nevski (all 2n = 14) developed normally but were completely sterile. Meiotic analyses revealed a high chiasma frequency indicating that the two species as well asP. juncea (Fisch.)Nevski share the same basic genome (called N). The hybrid nature of the plants was established through karyotype analysis and Giemsa C-banding. Psathyrostachys NEVSKI is one of the least known genera in the tribe Triticeae. The genus contains around 10 species and grows mainly in steppe communities from Caucasus to Western China (cf. TZV~LEV 1976 , DEWEY 1984 , LOVE 1984 . Most taxa are more or less endemic, and all hitherto studied material has been diploid (2 n = 14). One of the species, P. juncea (FIsCH.) NEVSKI (= Elymusjunceus FISCH.) known as "Russian wildrye" has received interest as a forage grass in North America. The other species are little known with respect to variation patterns, distribution, genome relationships and breeding potentials mainly due to the fact that a very restricted material has been available. DEWEY & HSIAO (1983) reported on the hybrid P. fragilis (BoIss.) NEVSK~ x P. juncea, and LINDE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER (1984a , b, 1986 ) studied the Giemsa Cbanding patterns of P. fragilis, P. juncea and the Chinese endemic species P. huashanica KENG. The present paper describes the interspecific hybrid and genome relationships between P. fragilis and P. huashanica. The plant material had the following origins: P. fragilis: Iran, prov.

(1983) while the C-banding technique was that of LINDE-LAtJRSEN & al. (1980) . The number of chromosomes with nucleolus forming capacity was determined through staining of interphases with AgNO 3 according to LINDE-LAURSEN (1984) . Only three crossing attempts were made. All resulted in seed set and hybrid plants ( Table 1 ). The single attempt with P. huashanica as the female parent functioned considerably better than the reciprocal cross, but too few crosses were made to permit any conclusions. All germinated seedlings developed normally into vigorous hybrid plants. A vernalization period of more than eight weeks was required to Fig. 1 ) between the parents with rather high, erect culms like P. huashanica. Vivipary occurred regularly in the lowermost flowers in some hybrid plants ( Fig. 1 C) . A total of 15 hybrids were raised. All were completely sterile with no viable pollen and no seed set. They were invariably diploids with 2 n = 14. The C-banded mitotic metaphases of the two hybrid plants studied showed seven chromosomes with large, telomeric, C-bands and seven chromosomes with small, telomeric, intercalary or proximal C-bands ( Fig. 2 A) . This corresponds to the patterns in the parents. Of these, P. huashanica has the large bands (LINDE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER 1986), and P. fragilis small ones (LTNDE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER 1984 a, b) . The presence of large C-bands was reflected in the observation of a number of large chromocentres in interphase nuclei (Fig. 2 D) . The haploid karyotype of P. huashanica may have two or three satellites (LINOE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER 1986, DEWEY & HSIAO, pers. comm.) . A satellite situated on the long arm of a metacentric chromosome can not always be identified. The satellite of this chromosome was not observed in the hybrid. The karyotype of P.fragilis showed three chromosomes with small to minute satellites. In accordance with the observation of a maximum of five SAT-chromosomes, up to five NOR regions were visible in AgNO3-stained metaphases (Fig. 2 (7) . In interphases up to five large (standard) nucleoli were expressed (Fig. 2 B) . In addition, two micronucleoli were sometimes seen (Fig. 2 B) . One of these is probably derived from the P. huashanica parent (LINDE-LAURSEN & R.v. BOTHMER & al. : BOTHNER 1984b) , while the other may be derived from either parent. The five standard nucleoli indicate that differential amphiplasty is not operating in the hybrid. As observed in other interspecific hybrids in the Tritieeae (cf. BENNETT 1984 , LINDE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER 1984 , there was a tendency that the genomes of each species were not randomly distributed in the metaphases of the hybrids (Fig. 2 A) . The P. fragilis chromosomes were usually found in a more central position. Meiosis in the hybrid was quite regular with a high degree of bivalent formation, and few uni-and trivalents (Fig. 3 A-C) . This gave an average chiasma frequency of 8.48 ( Table 2 ). The bivalents were predominantly rodshaped. A very characteristic feature was the high number of non-terminal chiasmata, mainly localized at proximal or interstitial positions (Fig. 3 A, B) . A few cells were completely asynaptic (Fig. 3 D) . Both parents also have a comparatively high number of non-terminal chiasmata (Table 2) .  . The systematic position of the Chinese endemic species P. huashanica has been questioned due to its deviating morphology and cytology. It has also been proposed that the species should be treated in a separate genus (DEWEY & HSIAO, pers. comm.). The haploid karyotype of P. huashaniea is quite characteristic and deviates from the very similar ones of P.fragilis and P. juncea, e.g. it has two chromosomes with large satellites, of which one is on the long arm of a metacentric chromosome (LINDE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER 1984a , 1986 DEWEy & HSIAO 1983, and pers. comm.) . However, the size of the chromosomes of all three species is rather similar and probably larger than in most other species in the Triticeae. The two species P.fragilis and P. juncea have very similar C-banding patterns, differing markedly from those of P. huashanica. The meiotic pairing in the hybrid P. huashanica x P. fragilis was comparatively high. The chiasma frequency, 8.48 per cell, was very similar to that found in the hybrid P.juncea x P.fragilis with an average of 9.09 per cell (DEWEY & HSIAO 1983) . Thus, despite the considerable dissimilarity of the mitotic chromosomes of P. huashanica it has a high genomic relationship with P. fragilis, obviously having the Genome relationship between Psathyrostachys huashanica and P. fragilis (Poaceae) -LAURSEN & al. 1980 , LINDE-LAURSEN & BOTHMER 1984 . However, all the forms are compatible and fertile. The hybrids have a high degree of meiotic pairing with multivalent formation in the polyploids indicating an autoploid series (DEWEY 1979 . For the interpretation of species relationships one has to be careful, especially in those plant groups in which there are discrepancies between mitotic chromosomal appearance and meiotic behaviour. An interesting observation both in the parental material and in the hybrid P. huashanica x P.fragilis is the high number ofnonterminal chiasmata. The chiasmata are located in interstitial or even proximal positions. This was also observed in the hybrid P. juncea x P. fragilis, but at a much lower frequency (DEWEY & HSIAO 1983, Fig. 2) . A high frequency of non-terminal chiasmata is rather rare in the whole tribe Triticeae. Even though all species have not been investigated the sharing of the same basic genome, called N by LOvE (1984) and DEWEY (1984) , of the three Psathyrostachys species hitherto studied, may indicate that the genus is fairly homogeneous. The relationship of the N genome of Psathyrostachys to other genera in Triticeae is poorly known since few crosses have been made.

('grandis', "The genome constitution ofRoegneria grandis (Poaceae, Triticeae) . Roegneria grandis was hybridized withR. ciliaris var.japonensis (2n = 28, SSYY),Elymus caninus (2n = 28, SSHH), andPseudoroegneria spicata (2n = 28, SSSS). Chromosome pairing was studied in parents and hybrids. It is concluded from this study that: (i)R. grandis is an allotetraploid species and contains the basic genomes S and Y: (ii) a certain degree of homoeology exists between the S and Y genomes of the species studied. Interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations between species and the analysis of chromosome pairing behaviour at metaphase I of meiosis in species and species hybrids have played an important role in the study of biosystematic relationships in the tribe Triticeae DUNORT (Poaceae) (KIHARA & NISHIYAMA 1930 , SEARS & OKAMOTO 1956 , KIMBEP, 1983 , DEWEY 1984 . The genus Roegneria was erected and circumscribed by C. KOCH (1848) with R. caucasica C. KOCH as its type species. The genus is the largest one of the Triticeae including about 120 species in the world and nearly 70 in China (Kuo 1987) . Most of the tetraploid species contain the basic genomes S and Y, e.g.R, ciliaris (TRIN.) NEVSKI, R. pendulina NEVSKI, R. stricta KENG, R. hondai KITAGAWA, R. caucasica C. KOCH, R. varia KENG, and R. dolichathera KENG (Lu & al. 1988 , 1990 Lu & SALOMON 1992; SUN & al. 1992) , whereas the hexaploids mostly have SHY genomes, e.g.R, tsukushiensis (HONDA (Lu ~:; al. 1990 , 1993 Lu & BOTHMER 1992; SAKAMOTO & MURAMATSU 1966a, b) . In 1959 R. grandis KENG was recorded as a new species in 'Flora illustralis plantarum primarum Sinicarum, Gramineae' by KENG (1959: 342-372 ), but it was described in Chinese and no Latin, diagnosis was given. KENG & CHEN (1963) described it in Latin in a revision of the genus Roegneria C. K o c h in China and made the name valid. The genomic constitution of R. 9randis is still unknown, so the systematic location of R. grandis has not yet been determined. The aim of the present paper is to give data on the cytogenetics and the genomic constitution of Roegneria 9randis. YANG. Spikes of the female parents were emasculated and covered with cellulose bags. A few days later, newly matured anthers were put into the maternal florets for pollination. The hybrid seeds were germinated on filter paper in petri-dishes and then potted at the two leaf stage. Spikes for cytological analysis were fixed in Carnoy's II solution (alcohol: chloroform: acetic acid = 6:3:1) for approximately 6 h and stored in 70% ethanol under refrigeration at 4 °C until used. Pollen mother cells (PMCs) were stained with acetocarmine. Pollen grains were stained in aqueous Iz-KI to estimate viability. ) B. R. Lv, YEN & J. L. YANG, R. drobovii NEVSKI, R. schrenkiana (FISH &-MEY.) NEVSKI . Cytology and fertility of species. All parents studied were tetraploid (2n = 28) (Table   1 ). Chromosome pairing at metaphase I was regular in 95% of the cells, which formed 14 bivalents (Table 3 , Fig. la-b ). Only R. ciliaris var. japonensis and E. caninus showed a very low frequency of univalents ( Fig. la, b ). The number of chiasmata per cell ranged from 25.04 to 27.50. Stainability of the pollen of R. grandis averaged 87%. That of the other species ranged from 60 to 90%. Fifty-one hand-emasculated florets ofR. 9randis pollinated with pollen from P. spicata produced 11 welldeveloped seeds, which resulted in 4 hybrids (2n --28) ( Table 2) . Hybrid morphology was intermediate between the parents. The tetraploid hybrids between R. 9randis and the analyser species P. spicata were used to identify the presence of the S genome in R. 9randis. Seven bivalents and fourteen univalents would be expected at metaphase I, if the S genome was not present. All metaphase I cells contained a high frequency of unpaired chromosomes, ranging from 6 to 12, with a mean of 8.32 univalents per cell, but sixty percent of the cells had more than 9 bivalents per cell with a maximum of 11. The average was 8.71 bivalents per cell. Multivalents, particularly trivalents, occurred in 35% of the metaphase I cells (Table 3 , Fig. 1d-f) . The mean number of chiasmata per cell was 14.33. The pairing relationships suggests that R. 9randis contains a somewhat modified form of the S genome present in P. spicata. R. ciliarisvar, japonensis(SSYY) x R. grandis. Sixty-six hand-emasculated florets of R. ciliaris var.japonensis pollinated with pollen from R. grandis produced two well-developed seeds, which resulted in one hybrid plant with 2n = 28 ( Table 2 ). The morphological characteristics of the hybrids were intermediate to those of the parents. The tetraploid hybrid between R. grandis and the analyzer species R. ciliaris var. japonensis was used to study possible presence of the S and Y genomes in R. grandis. One would expect 13 to 14 bivalents at metaphase I, if the S and Y genomes were present. The most frequent association was 14 bivalents, which occurred exclusively in 52 % of the cells. The hybrid averaged 0.79 univalents, 13.27 bivalents, 0.17 trivalents and 0.04 quadrivalents per cell (Table 3 , Fig. lg, h ), suggesting considerable homology between the genomes of the two species. Multivalents were rather frequent in the hybrid. This suggests either that structural rearrangements, e.g. translocations, have arisen between parental chromosomes, or, which seems more likely, that a certain degree of homoeology exists between the S and Y genomes in these Roegneria species (Lu & BOTHMER 1989 , 1990 Lu & al. 1990c Lu & al. , 1991 . Pairing in this hybrid strongly supports the hypothesis that (i) R. grandis comprises S and Y genomes and (ii) that a close affinity exists between R. grandis and R. ciliaris var. japonensis. At anaphase I, 25% of the cells contained lagging chromosomes; 38% of the quartets contained micronuclei, with an average of 0.76 micronuclei per quartet. The hybrids averaged 3% stainable pollen and none of the hybrids set seed under open-pollinated conditions. caninus hybrids were used to study the possible presence of the H genome of E. caninus in R. grandis. The cross involved 73 hand-emasculated fiorets of R. grandis pollinated by E. caninus. It produced 20 seeds, from which 9 hybrids were obtained (Table 2) . Hybrid morphology was intermediate to both parents. Some cells with 13 or 14 bivalents should have been observed at metaphase I, if the H genome of E. caninus was present in R. grandis. The maximum number of bivalents observed was seven, which occured in 33% of the cells. All metaphase I cells contained a high frequency of unpaired chromosomes, ranging from 14 to 20, with a mean of 15.93 univalents per cell (Table 3) . The most frequent association was 7 bivalents, which occurred in 66% of the cells. These hybrids had an average of 5.84 bivalents per cell (Table 3, Fig. lc ), suggesting that the addition of the H genome did not significantly increase the average number of bivalents formed beyond the number expected from the pairing ofS genomes present in the parents. Multivalents, particularly trivalents, were few, with an average of 0.13 trivalents per cell. Ninety-five percent of the cells at anaphase I contained lagging chromosomes, with an average of 3.60 laggards per cell. All quartets contained micronuclei averaging 4.30 per quartet. All anthers contained approximately 1% darkly stained pollen. No seeds were set in the hybrids under open-pollinated conditions. The pairing relationships in these hybrids supported that bivalent formation can be attributed to the presence of the S genomes in both parental species. (i) Roegneria grandis behaves as a strict allotetraploid, comprising two different genomes; (ii) chromosomes pairing in the F 1 hybrids suggests that R. 9randis comprises the genomes S and Y; (iii) according to the genomic constitution of R. grandis, it is a valid species of Roegneria which comprises taxa with SY and SHY genomes.

('acuminata', "Karyological differences among Tenebrionidae (Coleoptera) . Karyotypes obtained from spermatogonial metaphases of 20 tenebrionid species have been surveyed. The range of chromosome numbers is from 2n=16 to 2n=26, but only five species deviate from 2n=20, which is the modal and most primitive number of the family. Only the tribe Akidini shows a clear relationship between chromosome number (2n=16) and taxonomic group, while in the other species this relationship is not apparent. The mean total complement lengths in eleven species vary about twofold and the number of chromosome arms (NF) from 23 to 50. Some congeneric species ofTentyria, Hegeter andErodius displayed slight differences in the number of acrocentric chromosomes. The Tenebrionidae is an extensive family of beetles, mainly distributed over all xeric areas of the world (Crowson, 1981; Espafiol, 1984) and recently subjected to close scrutiny by taxonomists who have reached somewhat controversial conclusions (Watt, 1974; Doyen & Lawrence, 1979; Doyen & Tschinkel, 1982) . Many of them, however, agree in dividing the tenebrionids into two major groups, the Tenebrioninae and Tentyrinae, based mainly on the presence or absence of adult defensive abdominal glands, respectively. The tenebrionids generally have metacentric chromosomes, small or medium sized (1.5-5 #m) and a modal number of 2n = 20 (X, y) (Gu~nin, 1950; 1951a, b; Smith, 1952; Yadav & Pillai, 1974; Yadav et al., 1980) . We analyzed the chromosomes of 89 species from Mediterranean and Macaronesian areas (Juan & Petitpierre, 1985 , 1986 , 1988 Juan etal., 1989) . Here we present further data based on the karyotypes of 20 of the previous species, and these findings are discussed in relation to the evolutionary and taxonomic evidence. Table 1 shows the studied species, the numbers of individuals and their sources. Only male gonads were used for chromosome analysis. The testes were dissected from just sacrificed beetles, treated hypotonically for 10 min, fixed in Carnoy's solution for 1 h, subsequently teased in a drop of 45 ~o acetic acid and air dried (in some cases the fixed testes were squashed in 45 ~/o acetic acid, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the coverslip was removed with a sharp razor blade). The slides were stained with 4~o Giemsa in phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Chromosome measurements on selected micrographs of spermatogonial metaphases were performed with a fine micrometer and recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. The relative length of each element was expressed as percentage of half of the *Project number PB 87-0584-C02-01, Ministry of Education and Science, Spain  .

Monte del Agua (Tenerife, Spain) total length of the diploid set (including X and y chromosomes). The position of the centromere was estimated by the arm ratio (r = long arm length/short arm length), and the nomenclature used for this position is that given by Levan et al. (1964) . Figures 1-3 show the karyotypes represented by the haploid complements but including both male sex-chromosomes of the 20 tenebrionid species. The chromosomes were arranged according to decreasing size as is usual (genetic homology may not be implied when the chromosomes of distinct species are morphologically alike Table 2 for eleven species, of which at least three metaphase plates had been measured. There is a two-fold variation in the mean TCL (from 55.1/~m in Morica planata to 114.7/~m in Erodius emondi). The relative lengths of autosomes decrease progressively in all karyotypes, except in the two species of Tentyria, where the first autosome pair stands out clearly from the remaining pairs (Table 2) . The X chromosomes have a broad range of relative sizes (from 4.9~o in Micrositus semicostatus to 10.3~o in Morica planata). The Y-chromosomes are dotlike bodies, apparently metacentric except in Akis acuminata and Moricaplanata where they are acrocentrics of similar sizes to the smallest autosome pairs (Figs. 2C-2D ; Table 2 ). The mean arm ratios (Table 3) allow to distinguish a certain number of acrocentric chromosomes giving a range of total major chromosome arms ('nombre fondamental' of Matthey) from  . The karyotypes of tenebrionid beetles display a remarkable uniformity of gross chromosomal features: 65 % of the nearly 200 currently studied species share 20 chromosomes and the 'parachute' system of Xyp of male sex-chromosomes (Yadav etaL, 1980; Juan & Petitpierre, 1986 , 1988 . Their modal karyotypic formula of male metaphase I, 9 + Xyp; is also considered the ancestral one for the Coleoptera Polyphaga (Smith, 1950; Smith & Virkki, 1978; Virkki, 1984) , and it is also the modal one in other beetle families such as the Scarabaeidae, Coccinellidae and Cerambycidae (Petitpierre, 1988) . Our survey on the karyotypes of twenty species attempts to obtain a much clearer picture of the species interrelationships by a detailed morphological comparison of these chromosomal sets. Only five out the twenty species surveyed had diploid numbers differing from the modal (Akis acuminata and Morica planata, 2n = 16, Alphasida sp., 2n = 18, Melasmana lineatum 2n = 22, and Micrositus semicostatus, 2n = 26). While the former pair of species belong to a tribe (Akidini) composed of 16-chromosome taxa solely, a fact which reinforces the validity of the tribe, the latter pair are classified into tribes whose species possess 20-chromosomes mostly. These species show fairly symmetric complements except for some species of Tentyria with a rather large first autosome pair. Thus, the karyotypes of most tenebrionids appear to be built up on a very similar general pattern. In some groups of coleopterans the sex-chromosomes are well differentiated with respect to the autosomes (Smith & Virkki, 1978) . Those of our tenebrionids are constituted by a medium or commonly small X-chromosome, comparable in size to the smaller autosome pairs, while the y-chromosomes are usually dotlike. The only exceptions to this are found in Akis acuminata and Morica planata, both with 7 + neoXY, where an autosomal origin of the y-chromosomes seems to be highly probable (White, 1973) . Accordingly, the y-chromosomes of both Akis acuminata and Morica planata are clearly larger than the y chromosomes of any other species. Total complement length (TCL) differs among species. The range is nearly twofold, but nine among the eleven scored species exhibit a variation which does not exceed 35 ~o. Since TCL is generally correlated with genome size (Cavalier- Smith, 1985) , we may assume moderate differences in nuclear DNA content among these species of tenebrionids. The chromosomal shapes offer better means to discriminate between karyotypes of tenebrionids than do the previous aspects. The range of major chromosome arms per complement (NF) goes from 23 in Morica planata (2n = 16) to 50 in Micrositus semicostatus (2n = 26). In fact, some congeneric species can be differentiated according to the number of acro-subacrocentric chromosomes but not others. Thus, the Balearic Tentyria grossa, T. ophiusae and T. schaumi share NF = 36 while the Greek T. rotundata has NF = 32-34. Also, Erodius emondi and E. exilipes are distinguishable by their numbers of chromosomal arms, 38 and 40, respectively. The former species of Erodius agrees in its NF with another species, E. lefranci from North Africa (Juan & Petitpierre, 1988) . On the contrary, the Canarian genus Hegeter is very uniform karyologically since three out of the four checked species share 2n = 20 and NF = 40. Two allied species of the tribe Asidini, Asida planipennis and Alphasida sp, are well characterized with respect to the other tenebrionids by their low NF values, of 30 and 24, respectively. Furthermore, most suprageneric taxonomic groups of tenebrionids are not substantiated by the karyological data. Many more analyses and at a deeper level would be necessary to come up with safer conclusions on this subject.

('chinensis', "Plant regeneration from protoplasts of long-term callus cultures of Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayword (Kiwifruit) . Plant regeneration of Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayword was obtained from protoplasts isolated from petiole derived long-term callus cultures. Protoplasts were cultured in liquid medium over agarose gelled medium. Regenerated green callus, plated on solid medium, could develop shoots that rooted spontaneously in hormone-less medium. The plants obtained are growing fast in soil and present a normal phenotype. deliciosa var. deliciosa (kiwifruit) is a dioecious woody climbing species of Actinidiaceae, until 1984 known as Actinidia chinensis var. hispida (Liang and Ferguson 1984) . A. deliciosa is hexaploid with ca.170 chromosomes. From the female cultivars, . Hayword is the most important one, producing the largest fruits. Plant regeneration from protoplasts allows the use of genetic transformation techniques as well as of hybridization and cybridization. The use of these techniques may be important for the obtention of improved plants of kiwifruit. Among some reports on the isolation and culture of kiwifruit protoplasts (Cossio and Marino 1983; Marino 1986; Revilla and Power 1987; Pedroso et al. 1987; Mii and Ohashi 1988) , one is concerned with plant regeneration from protoplasts of stem derived suspension cultures of A. chinensis cv. Abbott (Mii and Ohashi 1988) . Tsai (1988) reported regeneration of plants from leaf callus protoplasts of A. chinensis vat. chinensis (a diploid species, 2n=58).

Protoplast isolation and cultur@ Actinidia delicios% (A.Chev.) C. F. Liang and A. R. Ferguson vat. deliciosa (Liang and Ferguson 1984) cv. Hayword (female cultivar) was used throughout the experiment. Petioles from healthy donor plants (grown in the field) were disinfected and sectioned as described by Pals et al. (1987) and inoculated on SH3 medium (macro-and micronutrients and vitamins of SH medium (Schenk and Hildebrandt 1972), with 20 g. 1-I sucrose, i0 g.l-1 mannitol, 5 mg.l-1 DTT, 1 mg.l-1 2,4-D, 0.i mg.l-1 Kin, 7 g.l-1 agar, pH 5.8). Two year old, fast growing friable white callus, maintained in darkness on SH3 medium with a 4 week subculture period, were used for protoplast obtention, at the third week after subculture. Thin slices (4 g) were incubated in glass Petri dishes (i0 cm diameter) for 16 h at 24 oC in I0 ml of the following mixture: CPW (Banks and Evans 1976) , 3 mM MES, 0.45 M Mannitol, 1.5% Cellulase Onozuka RIO, 0.5% Macerozyme RIO, pH 5.7. The digest was filtered through a I00 ~m stainless steel mesh, mixed with half volume of 0.6 M sucrose solution (with 0.1% MES) and centrifuged at 120 x g for 7 min with an overlay of W5 salt solution (Menczel et al. 1981) . Cleaned protoplasts were recovered from the interface, washed twice in W5 and kept in the cold (4 oC) for 1 h prior to culture, Viability was assessed with fluorescein diacetate or by observation of cytoplasmic streaming. Protoplasts, lOS/ml, were cultured using several culture methods: (1) liquid medium on glass and plastic (Nunclon) Petri dishes (5 cm diameter) and in suspended droplets from the lid of plastic Petri dishes containing a 0.25 M sucrose solution to moisten the chamber; .

One month later (eight months after culture initiation) rooted shoots were transferred to soil.

Embedding in agarose allowed 7-8% first divisions and 20-30% cell death, 2 weeks after culture initiation. At day 20 and 25, cell death increased to 50% and 60%, respectively. At day 25 10% of the surviving cells divided once and 4% divided twice, however the increased browning resulted in complete cell death during the 2nd to 3rd month. The use of bead type culture also proved inappropriate for _A. deliciosa protoplasts, since it accelerated browning and cell death. In agarose semi-solid cultures, cell wall regeneration and first divisions were delayed when compared with liquid over agarose culture. At day 30, 5% of the cells divided once and at day 60, 0.8% of the cells divided 3 times. This culture method was not followed. With liquid over agarose culture a few cells underwent a first division three days after culture initiation (Fig. 3) but during the first three months multiplication was slow ( Figs. 1 and 4) . Protoplasts aggregated and adhered to the agarose. Attempts to separate them, by carefully moving the Petri dish, were always detrimental, reducing viability and increasing browning. Aggregated protoplasts were often the first to divide. Cell division was not synchronized and at the third month of culture a few cells were still starting to divide (Fig. i) .  . Five to 6 x 106 protoplasts, with a viability of 97%, were obtained per g of callus tissue fresh weight. The protoplast size was variable (20-90 ~m) (Fig. 2) (Fig. 5) . After a second transfer to fresh regeneration medium dark green callus developed, often presenting'a globular appearance ( Fig. 7) . Shoots Cultures performed on medium containing 30 g.l-1 carbon source produced more anthocyanins, were less green, and produced fewer shoots than those performed on media with 20 g.l-1, with the exception of E1 with glucose (Fig. II) . Light intensities higher then 4 W/m2 promoted an increase of anthocyanin production and inhibition of shoot development. Irregular patterns of shoot initiation were often observed (Figs. 6, 8 and II ). In the conditions described we could regenerate 0.136 shoots/lO0 inoculated protoplasts. However, the transfer of developing shoots to H medium and the maintenance of the basal callus on the regeneration medium, was found to increase this ratio. When transferred shoots were at least 5 mm high, 93% of them could succeed on H medium. This efficiency was lower for smaller shoots, but did not seem to be related to the morphological diversity of the regenerated shoots. From 150 shoots 1 cm high and with at least two large leaves, 90% could root spontaneously one month after transfer to H2 medium (Fig. 9) . The other 10% of shoots were induced to root through immersion in the IBA solution or, alternatively, they were transferred to fresh H2 for further growth and rooted spontaneously after another month. Rooted shoots have succeeded and are growing fast in soil, so far presenting a normal phenotype (Fig. i0 ). Hayword, with the culture method we developed, 17% of plating efficiency was achieved 3 months after culture initiation. This lower initial efficiency gave high final regeneration yields, since from I00 innoculated protoplasts we could recover 0.136 shoots, and still increase this value by sub-culturing the basal callus on the regeneration medium after isolation of larger shoots. Transfer to different culture media seemed to have a positive effect on the efficiency of regeneration. The preconditioning effect and need of NAA prior to zeatin treatment verified for 4. deliciosa cv. Hayword was also reported for A chinensis cv. Abbott (Mii and Ohashi 1988) and for 4. chinensis var. chinensis (Tsai 1988) . Rooting of regenerated shoots was not difficult and it seemed to be dependent mostly on shoot size and leaf area. However the sub-culture on H medium, prior to H2 medium was determinant, since shoots transferred directly from the regeneration medium to H2 produced a large basal callus, presented short internodes and only 20% of them could root. Attempts to accelerate growth are being developed in order to shorten the period required for plant regeneration.

('fallax', "The correct interpretation and lectotypification of the name Cardamine fallax (Brassicaceae) . The name Cardamine fallax (O. E. Schulz) Nakai, based on Cardamine flexuosa subsp. fallax O. E. Schulz, is lectotypified by the specimen originating from Japan (Mama-mura, Shimosa) in accordance with the original description and with the current use of the name by the majority of Japanese and Korean authors. Contrary to the treatment in the recent editions of the Flora of China and Flora of Japan, hexaploid C. fallax is considered here as a taxon different from diploid C. parviflora L. The main morphological difference between these two species is in the shape of cauline leaves. Those of C. parviflora are pinnatisect (lower ones seldom pinnate), with oblanceolate to linear, entire or almost entire segments or leaflets, and those of C. fallax are pinnate, usually with petiolulate, lobate, pinnatipartite to pinnatisect leaflets. The distribution area of C. fallax includes Japan, Korea and Eastern China. The genus Cardamine, one of the largest genera of the Brassicaceae family, comprises more than 200 species distributed on all continents except mainland Antarctica. Major centers of its diversity, inferred from the total number of species and abundance of local endemics, appear to be in the Far East and the Himalayas with about 70 representatives (Al-Shehbaz 1988) . Nevertheless, unlike European species of the genus, to which considerable attention has been paid (summarized by , there are only few studies devoted to the Asian taxa. Here, we deal with the taxonomy and nomenclature of the Eastern Asian species C. fallax (O. E. Schulz) Nakai. Cardamine fallax was originally described as C. flexuosa subsp. fallax O. E. Schulz from Japan and China, and later reported also from Korea. It is currently recognized by some as a separate species (Kitagawa 1982; Kudoh et al. 1993; Pak 2005) or as a subspecies (Kimata 1983) or variety (Ohwi 1972 (Ohwi , 1984 Lee 1996; Cheo et al. 1987) of C. flexuosa. However, in the recent Flora of China (Zhou et al. 2001) and Flora of Japan (Al-Shehbaz et al. 2006) , both C. fallax and C. flexuosa subsp. fallax have been included in the synonymy of C. parviflora L. The lack of agreement among various authors about the taxonomic rank and status of Cardamine fallax prompted us to re-examine the problem more closely, especially in connection with C. parviflora and related species. The main and most apparent morphological difference between C. parviflora and C. fallax is in the shape of cauline leaves. While cauline leaves of C. parviflora are pinnatisect (lower ones sometimes pinnate), with 2-11 pairs of oblanceolate to linear, entire or almost entire segments or leaflets (Marhold 1995; Al-Shehbaz et al. in prep.) , those of C. fallax are pinnate, with 3-8 pairs of usually petiolulate, lobate, pinnatipartite to pinnatisect leaflets, narrowly ovate to obovate in outline. The general habit of C. fallax is similar to that of C. impatiens L., a species with which it is often misidentified and confused. The latter species always has auriculate stem leaves, whereas C. fallax always lacks the auricles. Consistent with the morphological differences between Cardamine fallax (sensu Japanese and Korean authors) and C. parviflora, molecular studies using both nrDNA ITS and cpDNA (trnL-trnF) sequence data showed that the two species belong to different, well-supported clades. Furthermore, C. fallax is hexaploid (2n = 6x = 48; Lihová, unpublished), whereas C. parviflora is diploid throughout its distribution area (2n = 2x = 16; for references see Kučera et al. 2005) . As shown by Kudoh et al. (2006) , C. parviflora in the original sense of Linnaeus (1753) is absent in Japan, and all reports of this taxon from Japan were based on misidentifications. Different origin and ploidy levels of European (tetraploid) and Asian (octoploid) populations of C. flexuosa preclude the infraspecific treatment of C. fallax within C. flexuosa and favor its status as a distinct species. In the protologue of Cardamine flexuosa subsp. fallax, Schulz (1903) cited several Japanese and Chinese specimens from herbaria such as B, GH, LE and US (listed as H. B., H. C., H. P. Ac. and H. N., respectively)-(for acronyms, see Holmgren et al. 1990 ). Part of this material was considered by Schulz (1903) as somewhat atypical, and for such specimens he coined the name C. flexuosa subsp. fallax f. microphylla. All specimens cited by Schulz from the Berlin herbarium (B) for C. flexuosa subsp. fallax and C. flexuosa f. microphylla, including all material of Chinese origin, were most probably lost during the fire in 1943 (Vogt, personal communication). The only two specimens identified by Schulz as C. flexuosa subsp. fallax f. microphylla and deposited currently in B were collected in 1904 and 1913, and they do not belong to the original material of that name. These two specimens, originating from China, were annotated by I. A. Al-Shehbaz in 2000 as C. parviflora and erroneously considered by Zhou et al. (2001) as ''syntypes'' of C. flexuosa subsp. fallax. Nevetheless, a duplicate of one of the specimens originally deposited in B (Faurie 3032) and cited by Schulz (1903) in the protologue, was found in KYO. The only specimen cited by Schulz (1903) from LE was not found in that herbarium during our visit in 2004, and it has been either lost or temporarily misplaced. Therefore, for the interpretation of the name C. flexuosa subsp. fallax and for its lectotypification, we are left with the specimens from the herbaria GH, US and KYO. Altogether, there are five specimens, all originating from Japan, which should be considered as potential lectotypes of the name Cardamine flexuosa subsp. fallax: . (1) Japonia, s. dat., s. coll., s. n. (Fig. 1) . 4 There is only one specimen left, which belongs to the original material of the name C. flexuosa f. microphylla: (Fig. 2 , two plants on the right side of the herbarium sheet). (6) [Japan], . Specimens 3, 5 and 6 correspond well to the description of Cardamine flexuosa subsp. fallax and Cardamine flexuosa f. microphylla, respectively, as given in their protologues. They also all fit to the current concept of C. fallax (: C. flexuosa subsp. fallax : C. flexuosa var. fallax) reported in the recent Japanese and Korean literature, as explained above. Specimen 1 very likely belongs to the taxon referred to by as ''Asian C. flexuosa'' and treated by Schulz (1903) as C. flexuosa subsp. debilis O. E. Schulz. This is an octoploid taxon shown by to be phylogenetically different from both the tetraploid native European C. flexuosa and hexaploid C. fallax. Its correct name at the species level remains to be resolved. Specimens 2 and 4 are fragmentary and, although they might belong to C. fallax, they cannot be excluded as ''Asian C. flexuosa'' (C. flexuosa subsp. debilis). Taking into account the above-mentioned facts, we have decided to select as a lectotype of the name C. flexuosa subsp. fallax specimen 3, which will fix the correct application of the name according to Japanese and Korean authors (Kitagawa 1982; Kudoh et al. 1993; Pak 2005) . Specimen 6 represents the only extant original material of Cardamine flexuosa f. microphylla, and it is selected here as the lectotype of this name, which is considered by us as a synonym of C. fallax. (Fig. 2, larger plant on the right side of the herbarium sheet). Based on the study of herbarium specimens from AKPM, B, GH, KYO, MAK, PE, TI, TNS, TUS, US (for acronyms see Holmgren et al. 1990 ), Shoei Junior College and Iwate Prefectural Museum (both in Japan), the species is restricted to Eastern China, the Korean Peninsula and Japan (Fig. 3) . In Japan, it occurs on the islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku but seems to be absent from Hokkaido (Fig. 3) . The species is a strict winter annual, and its seeds germinate in autumn and overwinter as rosettes. The flowering periods are from late April to June (Kudoh et al. 1993 ). The species does not occur on dry or water-logged soils, and in Japan it grows along forest edges, roads and rivers, where the density of vegetation covers are reduced by mowing or flooding during the summer period. The flowers of the species are self-compatible and produce many seeds, presumably through self-pollination. (Herb. Ludg. Batav.) (GH), annotated by O. E.

('thibetica', "Ypsilandra (Melanthiaceae; Liliaceae sensu lato), a new generic record for Taiwan . Ypsilandra thibetica Franch. (Liliaceae sensu lato), previously known only from southcentral and southern China (Sichuan, S. Hunan and NE Guangxi), was recently found in mountainous regions of central and eastern Taiwan. The discovery adds a new record for the species, and for the genus, to the flora of Taiwan. Ypsilandra can be easily distinguished from other genera of Liliaceae by its rosette of basal leaves, racemose inflorescence, and 3-lobed capsules. This paper provides a taxonomic account of the genus, a line drawing and color photographs to aid in identification. The somatic chromosome number and karyotype formula (2n=34=18m+10sm(superscript 4SC)+6st(superscript 2SC)) are reported for Y. thibetica for the first time. Liliaceae sensu lato, a family widespread throughout the world, consists of about 280 genera and 4,000 species (Cronquist, 1981) . Taxonomy of the family in Taiwan has been revised recently by Ying (1988 Ying ( , 1989 Ying ( , 1990 , Huang and Yang (1988) , Hara (1987 Hara ( , 1988 , Tanaka (1998 Tanaka ( , 2001a Tanaka ( , 2001b , Lang et al. (1999) , Ohashi (2000) , Hiramatsu et al. (2001) and Peng et al. (2007) . Twenty-two genera and 31 species, one subspecies and fourteen varieties were recorded in the Flora of Taiwan, 2 nd Edition (Ying, 2000) . During our botanical inventory of Taiwan, Ypsilandra thibetica Franch., a heretofore unrecorded species, was discovered in mountainous regions in central and eastern Taiwan. Ypsilandra Franch. comprises six species in mainland China, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Vietnam (Chen and Tamura, 2000; Chen et al., 2003; Shaw, 2008) . Our discovery of Y. thibetica on Taiwan represents a significant range extension for both the genus and the species. Plants of Ypsilandra thibetica from Nantou Hsien, Taiwan were cultivated in the experimental greenhouse of Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan. Somatic chromosomes were observed using at least three cells per individual. Methods of pretreatment, fixation, and stain-Botanical Studies (2011) 52: 99-104. Franch., Nouv. Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat.

The chromosome number and karyotype of Ypsilandra thibetica are documented here for the first time. Somatic chromosomes at mitotic metaphase of Ypsilandra thibetica were determined to be 2n = 34, with bimodal variation in length (Figure 4 ). Of the 34 chromosomes two were markedly longer (about 2.9 µm) than the others; the remaining 32 shorter chromosomes varied gradually from about 1.3 to 2.2 µm long. Irrespective of length, 18 (Nos. 3, 4, 7, 8, (11) (12) (13) (14) 17, 18, (23) (24) (25) (26) 29, 30 and 33, 34), 10 (Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 27, 28 and 31, 32) , and 6 (Nos. 15, 16, 19-22) chromosomes had median (m), submedian (sm) and subterminal (st) centromeres, respectively ( Figures 4B, C) . Secondary constrictions were observed at the interstitial region of the long arm in four submedian (Nos. 1, 2 and 5, 6) and two subterminal (Nos. 15 and 16) chromosomes. Thus, the karyotype formula of Y. thibetica is 2n = 34 = 18m+10sm 4SC +6st 2SC . The same chromosome number was reported in two closely related genera: for seven species of Heloniopsis (Ono, 1926; Nakajima, 1933; Sakai, 1934; Chuang et al., 1962; Nakamura, 1967; Hsu, 1971; Kurosawa, 1982; Nishikawa, 1989; Kokubugata et al., 2004) and the sole species of Helonias, H. bullata (Miller, 1930; Utech, 1980) . The karyotypes of Heloniopsis orientalis (Nakamura, 1967) , H. kawanoi, H. leucantha, and H. umbellata (Kokubugata et al., 2004) , and Helonias bullata (Utech, 1980) were given in those reports. Kokubugata et al. (2004) reported the karyotypes of all three species of Heloniopsis examined to be similar, showing a karyotype formula of 2n = 34 = 28m 2SC +6sm 2SC . The karyotypes of Heloniopsis orientalis (Nakamura, 1967) and Helonias bullata (Utech, 1980) were also analyzed, but the classification of chromosome morphology used in those two reports was different from the classification used in this paper. Judging from the drawings of chromosome complements at mitotic metaphase of Heloniopsis orientalis (Figures 1-4 : p. 2317) presented by Nakamura (1967) and the measurements of haploid chromosome length of Helonias bullata (Table 1: p. 156) presented by Utech (1980) , the karyotype formula of Heloniopsis orientalis and Helonias bullata is regarded to be 2n = 34 = 24m 6SC +10sm, and 2n = 34 = 8m+24sm 4SC +2st 2SC , respectively. The karyotype formula for Ypsilandra thibetica presented here is clearly distinguishable from those of Heloniopsis and Helonias. Notes. Ypsilandra is a member of the Liliaceae sensu lato. Takhtajan (1997) treated the genus in the Heloniadaceae, while Tamura (1998) and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2009) classified it in the Melanthiaceae. The close relationships between the North American Helonias and the Asian Heloniopsis and Ypsilandra have been noted repeatedly. The three genera exhibit many similarities in morphology and anatomy (Tanaka, 1997a (Tanaka, , 1997b (Tanaka, , 1997c (Tanaka, , 1997d (Tanaka, , 1997e, 1998 , palynology (Takahashi and Kawano, 1989) , and ecology (Kawano and Masuda, 1980) . Tanaka (1998) reduced Heloniopsis and Ypsilandra to synonymy under Helonias. Nevertheless, molecular evidence confirms that the three genera are distinct, and the taxonomic reduction may be unnecessary (Fuse and Tamura, 2000) . Geographically, Helonias, Ypsilandra, and Heloniopsis are allopatrically distributed. Helonias, a monotypic genus, is in southeastern North America (Zomlefer, 1997) . In contrast, Ypsilandra and Heloniopsis are widespread in eastern Asia (Tanaka, 1997e) . The distribution range of Ypsilandra is west of that of Heloniopsis. Our discovery of Ypsilandra in Taiwan represents a significant range extension of Ypsilandra thibetica and the first report of sympatric occurrence of Ypsilandra and Heloniopsis. Although two editions of the Flora of Taiwan have already been published (1975-1979; 1994-2003) , many new species and distribution records continue to be reported. Some of these include a holoparasitic species of Phacellanthus (Orobanchaceae), recently discovered in the cloud zone of a mixed Chamaecyparis/broadleaved forest (Chung et al., 2010) ; Clematis chinensis var. tatushanensis, reported along a lowland forest margin in western Taiwan (Yang, 2009) ; Begonia ×chungii, a natural hybrid, reported from an experimental forest/eco-resort in central Taiwan (Peng and Ku, 2009) ; three new species of Asarum, two from northeastern Taiwan and one from the southern end of the Central Mountain Range (Lu and Wang, 2009) ; also from this mountain range, but at a lower elevation, Swertia changii (Chen and Yang, 2008) ; and a new species, Veronicastrum loshanense, found near a waterfall in eastern Taiwan (Chen and Chou, 2008) . Nearly all of these plants are herbaceous and have a very restricted range of distribution. These recent findings indicate that the documentation of the island's vast and unique biodiversity is incomplete. Support is necessary for the continuation of these botanical inventories, especially to areas of difficult access and to those areas rarely botanized. Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. 2009.

('arundinacea', "Discriminating the ancestral progenitors of hexaploid Festuca arundinacea using genomic in situ hybridization . The phylogeny of Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (2n = 6x = 42) was determined using GISH. Total genomic DNA of putative ancestral species was labelled with rhodamine and hybridized to chromosome preparations of hybrids involving these species and F. arundinacea. The degree of hybridization to chromosomes known to be homologous to the probe DNA was compared with that found simultaneously on chromosomes of the genome of F. arundinacea. It was concluded that the tetraploid species Festuca arundinacea var. glaucescens contributed two genomes and the diploid species Festuca pratensis one, to create the allohexaploid species F. arundinacea. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is a hexaploid (2n-'6x=42), bivalent forming species with a wide range of distribution from North Africa to northern Europe (Borrill et al., 1976) . The tetraploid species F. arundinacea var. glaucescens Boiss (2n 4x =28) (referred to here as F. glaucescens) and the diploid F. pratensis Huds. (2n = 2x = 14) were proposed as two of the progenitors of F arundinacea by Chandrasekharan & Thomas (1971) . They based their conclusions on the evidence of close morphological similarities between the F1 hybrid F. glaucescens X F. pratensis and tall fescue, together with data on the meiotic behaviour of hybrids and derivatives. Several authors considered that F. pratensis was the source of the A genome of F. glaucescens (Malik & Thomas, 1967; Chandrasek- haran & Thomas, 1971) . Others agreed that F. pratensis was one genome in hexaploid F. arundinacea but that it and F. glaucescens were separate genomes and together led to the formation of the hexaploid species (Sleper & Nelson, 1990; Humphreys & Ghesquière, 1994; Xu & Sleper, 1994 ). The precise nature of differentiation at the molecular level between chromosomes of species within the Lolium/Festuca complex can be revealed through the use of in situ hybridization techniques (Thomas et a!., tCorrespondence. 1995 The Genetical Society of Great Britain. 171 1994); the chromosomes of different species can be identified by using genomic DNA probes together with excess quantities of DNA of the other species as blocker. In this report we describe a series of in situ hybridization studies involving three hybrids between F pratensis, F. glaucescens and F arundinacea to confirm the phylogeny of the hexaploid species. The hybrids F pratensis X F glaucescens and F pratensis x F arundinacea were produced by pollinating synthetic autotetraploid cytotypes (2n = 4x = 28) of F pratensis with the other two species. A hexaploid hybrid combining the two haploid genomes of F glaucescens, one genome of L. multiflorum and the three genomes of F. arundinacea was produced by doubling the chromosome number of the F1 hybrid L. multiflorum (2x) X F glaucescens (4x) and pollinating the amphiploid with F. arundinacea (6x). The hybrids therefore had the following proposed genomic constitutions. (1) F pratensis(P) x F glaucescens(G)(4x)-PPGG; . (2) F pratensis ( . P) x F arundinacea (PG) (5x) -PPPGG; (3) L. multf7orum (M) x F glaucescens (G))< F arundinacea (PG) (6x) -MPGGGG. All hybrids required embryo rescue. Mitoses from root tip meristems were used as substrate for in situ hybridization with total genomic DNA probe (TGP) from F. pratensis and F. glaucescens. The methods of root tip preparations, DNA extraction and labelling, and in situ hybridization were as described by Thomas et at. (1994) . All of the TGPs were labelled with rhodamine-4-dUTP (Fluoro-red, Amersham) after first being sheared to 200 to 1000 base pairs by suspending a microfuge tube containing the DNA in an ultrasonic bath for 6 mm. All preparations were counterstained with DAPI and mounted in Vectashield antifade. They were examined using a Leitz DM microscope. DAPI and rhodamine images were photographed and superimposed on Kodak Ektachrome 400 HC slide film. The tetraploid hybrid contains two homologous sets of F. pratensis chromosomes and the two genomes of F. glaucescens. The hybrid was probed with F pratensis TGP: 14 chromosomes fluoresced and 14 were dull with minimal cross hybridization (Fig. la) . This result shows that the F pratensis genome is not present in F glaucescens. F. pratensis (4x) X F. arundinacea 6xOn the assumption that there is close affinity between F. pratensis and one of the genomes of F. arundinacea, the F. pratensis TGP would be expected to hybridize to 21 chromosomes of the hybrid. As can be seen in Fig. lb. 21 chromosomes do fluoresce confirming that F pratensis is one of the progenitors of the hexaploid species since the third set of 7 chromosomes that fluoresce has to be one of the F arundinacea genomes. (L. multiflorum X F. glaucescens) (6x) X F. arundinacea (6x) . This hybrid contains the three genomes of F. arundinacea, the two genomes of F. glaucescens and one genome of L. mutti:florum. When the F glaucescens TGP was used with L. muttiflorum and F. pratensis DNA as blocker, 28 chromosomes fluoresced red and 14 chromosomes remained dull. F glaucescens DNA has therefore hybridized to the F gtaucescens genomes and to two of those from F arundinacea. This is evidence that two of the F arundinacea genomes are homologous to those of F. glaucescens. The evidence obtained in this study of phylogenetic relationships based on in situ hybridization confirms previous conclusions that the hexaploid species The Genetical Society of Great Britain, Heredity, 75, 171-174.

Bar' 1Oim. evolved from a hybrid involving F glaucescens and F pratensis (Chandrasekharan & Thomas, 1971; Sleper & Nelson, 1990) . Total genomic probes can be used to distinguish between chromosomes of different species within the Lolium/Festuca complex, relying on speciesspecific repetitive DNA sequences. Perez-Vicente eta!. (1992) isolated species-specific DNA sequences from L. mu1tf1orum and F. arundinacea. Some similarities were found between F arundinacea and F pratensis but these similarities did not extend to L. multifiorum. The precise comparison based on the structure of DNA therefore rules out the involvement of the ryegrass genome in the evolution of tall fescue. The results of the in situ hybridization confirm the conclusions of the earlier reports that F arundinacea is derived from a hybrid between the diploid species F pratensis and the tetraploid F glaucescens. Any uncertainty whether F pratensis had contributed a genome to F glaucescens was resolved; the hybridization of F pratensis TGP only to the F pratensis and not the F glaucescens chromosomes in the tetraploid hybrid between the two species was unequivocal proof that F pratensis was not a progenitor of F glaucescens. A large proportion of the genome of higher plants consists of repetitive DNA and the mechanism by which this DNA has accumulated, i.e. by cycles of mutations and amplifications, seems to have ensured that much of this DNA is species-specific (Flavell et a!. 1980 ). Genomic in situ hybridization relies on the specificity of the repetitive DNA and appears to be very effective in making comparisons between the related genomes of the Lolium/Festuca complex. The substrate for the GISH in each case was a mitotic preparation of a F1 hybrid that involved the species used as probe. This provided an internal control because a known number of chromosomes were fully homologous with the probe. It enabled a direct comparison to be made between the degree of hybridization to the chromosomes of the present day putative progenitors and those of the hexaploid. In some cells there appeared to be some differentiation, that is, the signal was brighter on some chromosomes than others. This may indicate changes to the DNA of F arundinacea subsequent to the formation of the initial hybrid, or that the accessions of F. pratensis and F glaucescens used were not fully homologous with the genotype of the progenitors. Cytogenetic analysis based on predictive mathematical formulae to quantify relationships between genomes of different species had indicated that the ryegrass genome was more closely related to one of the tall fescue genomes than the other two (Kleijer, 1984) . This was also demonstrated by Humphreys & Ghesquière (1994) who set up pentaploid hybrids of L. multi-The Genetical Society of Great Britain, Heredity, 75, 171-174. florum (4x) x F arundinacea in which different alleles at the PGI/2 locus marked the two homologous chromosomes of ryegrass and the three homologous tall fescue chromosomes. They were able to show that one of the fescue alleles recombined at a greater frequency than the other two in backcrosses to a diploid L. multiflorum. In view of the data presented in this paper it would be reasonable to assume that this would be the allele marking the genome derived from F pratensis. The distribution of fescue species has been recorded by Borrill et al. (1976) and probably adapted to the conditions in those specific regions, but with the acquisition of the F pratensis genome it became more adaptable as the hexaploid species and was able to spread throughout most of the regions occupied by F pratensis. This is very similar to the effect of the D genome in the evolution of bread wheat (Zohary & Feldman, 1962) . The distribution of the relevant species would also indicate that central Europe is the probable region where F arundinacea evolved as a product of the natural hybridization of the 2x and 4x species; this conclusion would be in accord with the designation of this region as the centre of diversity of temperate grass species (Hartley & Williams, 1956; Borrill, 1972) . who found that the tetraploid species F glaucescens is confined mainly to the southern European mountains and probably extends to central and eastern Europe. The diploid species F pratensis is distributed throughout the climatic regions of oceanic north-west Europe and the transitional oceanic/continental zone of central Europe. F arundinacea is as ubiquitous as the diploid F pratensis except that it is less common in the colder winter conditions of northern Europe and the drier regions of northern Italy. F pratensis is also more prevalent at higher altitudes than F arundinacea.

('denticulatus', "Sinosenecio hupingshanensis (Asteraceae), a new species from Hunan and Hubei, China. Sinosenecio hupingshanensis Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang, a new species of the Asteraceae from Hunan and Hubei, China, is described and illustrated. Its karyotype is formulated as 2n = 44m + 2sm + 2st, giving a chromosome number of 2n = 48. This new species is similar to S. baojingensis Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang and S. denticulatus J. Q. Liu in its posture, floral morphology and pappose achenes. It differs from S. baojingensis in leaf shape and stature. From S. denticulatus it differs in the leaf-lamina being very indistinctly repand, pubescent above, the petioles expanded but never auriculate at the base, and in its smaller stature. Line drawings, distribution map, light microscope (LM) microphotographs of floral characters of S. hupingshanensis, color photographs of both S. hupingshanensis and S. denticulatus, and a key to aid in the identification of S. hupingshanensis and its possible relatives are provided. For the first author's Ph.D. project on the systematics and evolution of Sinosenecio B. Nord. (Senecioneae, Asteraceae), we made a comprehensive survey of the specimens of this genus deposited in Chinese herbaria. One specimen kept in the Herbarium of Jishou University (JIU), Hupingshan Expedition P-010, made from the southern slope of the Hupingshan Mountain, Shimen County, Hunan Province, China, caught our attention. This plant had been previously identified as S. globigerus (Chang) B. Nord., very likely owing to their similarity in leaf shape and posture. Upon a closer examination, however, we found that the plant in question differs markedly from S. globigerus by the 6-7-veined rays and, in particular, the pappose achenes. In S. globigerus, the rays are 4-veined, and the achenes are absolutely epappose. We made a botanical expedition in April 2007 to the Hupingshan Mountain and carefully observed the plant in the field, confirming that the plant represents a hitherto undescribed species. Further herbarium and field work resulted in the discovery of more herbarium specimens and of another three populations of this new species, which we name as S. hupingshanensis and describe below. The Hupingshan Natural Reserve lies in Shimen County in northwestern Hunan Province, China. It occupies an area of about 66,568 ha, between 29°50´ and 30°09´ N and 110°29´ and 110°59´ E, and ranges from 220 to 2100 m in elevation. It is covered by natural forests and is an important area for biodiversity conservation. In our botanical inventory of this reserve, we found five species of Sinosenecio: S. eriopodus (Cumm.) C. Jeffrey & Y. L. Chen, S. globigerus (Chang) B. Nord., S. oldhamianus (Maxim.) B. Nord., the new species (here named S. hupingshanensis), and a species that is somewhat similar to S. palmatisectus (J. F. Jeffrey) Y. L. Chen in aspect but differs in a series of characters; identification of this last is deferred pending further study. ligulis 6-7-nerviis, acheniis laevibus pappis praeditis, ab illo foliorum laminis reniformibus vel orbicularireniformibus, margine indistinctissime repandis, ab hoc foliorum laminis margine tantum indistinctissime repandis, supra pubescentibus, petiolis tantum basi dilatatis, haud auriculatis, ab ambobus planta breviore, 16-60 cm alta differt.

Hunan, Shimen County, southern slope of the Hupingshan Mountain, Yuantouhe River, Shi-gun-tang, alt. Etymology. The specific epithet 'hupingshanensis' is derived from the type locality, the Hupingshan Mountain, Shimen County, Hunan Province, China. Phenology. Flowering from April to May; fruiting from May to June. Distribution and habitat. Sinosenecio hupingshanensis is currently known from four populations in the Hupingshan Natural Reserve, one on the northern slope within Hubei Province and the other three on the southern slope within Hunan Province, China (Figure 3) , growing in shady places along the margin of mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests at altitudes between 1,000-1,600 m above the sea level. Floral micromorphological characters. For observation of the anther endothecial cell wall thickenings and filament collar of Sinosenecio hupingshanensis, heads were boiled in distilled water for 3 min, and then fixed with Carnoy I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol = 1:3). Mature disc florets removed from the fixed heads were dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 30 min and then in 99% ethanol for 1 h before they were treated with 5% NaOH overnight. The anther tissue was isolated from the florets on the slide, flooded with 50% glycerol and a cover slip was applied. Samples were then examined at 200× (filament collar) and 400× (endothecial cell wall thickenings) magnification by light microscopy and photographed. The anther endothecial cell wall thickenings of Sinosenecio hupingshanensis were polar and radial ( Figure  4A ), conforming to the results reported previously that endothecial cell wall thickenings are strictly polar, polar and radial or radial in other species of Sinosenecio (Jeffrey and Chen, 1984; Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Liu and Yang, 2010) . As shown in Figure 4B , the filament collar of S. hupingshanensis consisted of uniformly sized cells, which is one of the diagnostic features of the genus (Nordenstam, 1978; Jeffrey and Chen, 1984) . from the largest to the smallest in size, and the karyotype was highly symmetrical. Notes. Based on its polar and radial endothecial cell wall thickenings, the presence of cauline leaves, glabrous ovaries and achenes, S. hupingshanensis can be referred to subsection Madarogyne C. Jeffrey & Y. L. Chen, section Phyllocaulon C. Jeffrey & Y. L. Chen. It is similar to S. baojingensis (Liu et al., 2009, and Figures 1, 2 therein) and S. denticulatus J. Q. Liu (Figure 6 ) within this section in its posture, 6-7-veined rays and glabrous achenes with a pappus. As shown in Table 1 , it differs from S. baojingensis in its leaf-lamina reniform or orbicularreniform (vs. ovate-cordate), margin very indistinctly repand (vs. strictly entire), smaller-sized (4.5-12 × 5-13 cm vs. 12-20 × 10-18 cm), and much smaller stature (16-60 cm vs. 75-150 cm). From S. denticulatus, it differs in the leaf-lamina being very indistinctly repand (vs. shallowly 5-7-palmatilobed), pubescent above (vs. subglabrous, sparsely pubescent along the veins), the petioles expanded but never auriculate at the base (vs. auriculate), and the smaller stature (16-60 cm vs. 35-140 cm). The three species mentioned above can be distinguished by features in the following key. Chromosome cytology. For chromosome observation, root tips were pretreated with 0.1% colchicine for 3 h before being fixed in Carnoy I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol = 1: 3), then macerated in a 1:1 mixture of 45% acetic acid and 1 M HCl at 60°C for 3 min, stained and squashed in Carbol fuchsin. One population (Hupingshan Exped. 080428030, JIU) of Sinosenecio hupingshanensis was cytologically studied. In the interphase nuclei, a few darkly stained condensed bodies were observed, but their boundaries were not clear, because the other part was also stained fairly well but unevenly ( Figure 5A ). The prophase chromosomes displayed a distinctly continuous condensation pattern ( Figure 5B ). The metaphase chromosomes were counted to be 2n = 48 ( Figure 5C ). The chromosome number of its two possible relatives, S. baojingensis Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang and S. denticulatus J. Q. Liu, is also 2n = 48 (Liu et al., 2009; Ying Liu & Qin-er Yang, unpublished data) . Based on the nomenclature of chromosomes of Levan et al. (1964) , S. hupingshanensis had 44 median-centromeric (m), 2 submedian-centromeric (sm) and 2 subterminalcentromeric (st) chromosomes ( Figure 5D ), i.e. 2n = 48 = 44m + 2sm + 2st.

Phenology.FloweringfromMaytoJune;fruitingfrom JunetoJuly. Distribution, habitat and status. Sinosenecio yilingii is currently known only from one population found in a ravine in Baoxing County, Sichuan Province, China (Figure 4 ), growing in grasses or on rocks of streamside along margin of deciduous broad-leaved forests at an altitudeofca.2,200mabovethesealevel.Ifthisistruly the only population, then according to the IUCN red list categories and criteria, version 3.1 (IUCN, 2001) , S. yilingii should be categorized as a critically endangered species (CR). Perhaps the most serious threat to the species' survival lies in the ongoing habitat destruction throughmining. Floral micromorphological characters.Forobservation of the anther endothecial cell wall thickenings and filament collar of Sinosenecio yilingii, heads were boiled in distilled water for 3 min, and then fixed with Carnoy I (glacialaceticacid:absoluteethanol=1:3).Maturedisc florets removed from the fixed heads were dehydrated in 70%ethanolfor30minandthenin99%ethanolfor1h before they were treated with 5% NaOH overnight. The anther tissue was isolated from the florets on the slide, flooded with 50% glycerol and a cover slip was applied. Samples were then examined at 200× (filament collar) and 400× (endothecial cell wall thickenings) magnification by lightmicroscopyandphotographed. The endothecial cell wall thickenings in Sinosenecio yilingii were strictly polar ( Figure 5A ), a character found to occur in some members of Sinosenecio sect. Sinosenecio (JeffreyandChen,1984) .Inthemembersof Sinosenecio sect. Phyllocaulon C. Jeffrey &Y. L. Chen, the endothecial cell wall thickenings are radial or radial andpolar (JeffreyandChen,1984; Zhangetal.,2008; Liu et al., 2009) . As indicated in Figure 5B , its filament collar consisted of uniformly sized cells, conforming to one of thediagnosticcharactersofthisgenus (Nordenstam,1978; JeffreyandChen,1984) . Chromosome cytology.Forchromosomeobservation, root tips were pretreated with 0.1% colchicine for 3 h before being fixed in Carnoy I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol = 1: 3), then macerated in a 1:1 mixture of 45% acetic acid and 1 M HCl at 60°C for 3 min, stained and squashedinCarbolfuchsin. Intheinterphasenuclei,afewdarklystainedcondensed bodies were observed, but their boundaries were not clear, because the other part was also stained fairly well but unevenly ( Figure 6A ). The prophase chromosomes displayed a distinctly continuous condensation pattern ( Figure 6B ). The metaphase chromosomes were counted to be 2n = 60 ( Figure 6C ). Based on the nomenclature of chromosomes of Levan et al. (1964) , Sinosenecio yilingiihad56median-centromeric(m)and4submediancentromeric (sm) chromosomes ( Figure 6D ), i.e. 2n = 60 = 56m + 4sm. The chromosomes changed gradually fromthelargesttothesmallestinsize,andthekaryotype was highly symmetrical. The chromosome number 2n = 24 reported by Liu (1999) for S. homogyniphyllus, the close relative of S. yilingii, may represent a wrong count, most likely owing to misidentification of material, as the material examined by him was obtained as a gift from an anonymous person.

('rechingeri', "Genome relationships in theElytrigia group of the genusAgropyron (Poaceae) as indicated by seed protein electrophoresis . Agropyron bessarabicum (2n = 14),A. rechingeri (2n = 28),A. junceiforme (2n = 28),A. elongatum (2n = 14),A. flaccidifolium (2n = 28) andA. scirpeum (2n = 28) were studied by isoelectric focusing of seed soluble proteins.—The protein profiles obtained from the six taxa showed a striking degree of similarity; typically they consist of 40 bands. No qualitative but only quantitative differences (in the intensity of some bands) were found.—Combined with the cytological information available these protein data indicate that the two polyploid complexes must be placed in the recently erected genusThinopyrum with the genome designations:T. bessarabicum Jj1 Jj1,T. sartorii (=A. rechingeri) Jj1 Jj1 Jj3 Jj3,T. junceiforme Jj1 Jj1 Jj2 Jj2,T. elongatum Je1 Je1,T. flaccidifolium Je1 Je1 Je1 Je1 andT. scirpeum Je1 Je1 Je2 Je2. . However, present knowledge does not allow a precise estimation of the genome relations among the two poplyploid complexes (DEwv.Y & HSIAO 1983 , DEWEY 1984 . The applicability of seed protein electrophoresis to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between diploid and polyploid taxa is shown by the extensive literature on the subject (LADIZINSKY & HYMOWITZ 1979 , MOUSTAKAS & al. 1986 . In the present study isoelectric focusing was selected among the electrophoretic techniques since it affords the highest resolution. Recently, two classification systems of Tritieeae slightly differing from each other and both based on genomic relationships were published (LOVE 1984 , DEWEY 1984 . The taxa of the two complexes were placed in the same genus (Thinopyrum) by DEWEY (1984) but in two different genera (Thinopyrum and Lophopyrum) by LOvE (1984) . The sources of the seed materials examined cytologically and subjected to electrophoresis are as follows: Agropyron bessarabicum: Greece: Euboea, littoral zone; A. rechingeri: Greece: Naxos, in schistose littoral rocks; A. flaccidifolium: Greece: Naxos. The seeds of all three above mentioned taxa were collected by MOUSTAKAS & SYMEONIDIS and the voucher specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Thessaloniki (TAU). A. elongatum: cultivated at Versailles; A. junceiforme: French Atlantic coast; A. scirpeum: . Italian coast; seeds of these three taxa were kindly made available by Y. CAUDERON; voucher specimens are deposited at I.N.R.A. Versailles, France. All materials, before being subjected to electrophoresis, were examined cytologically with the usual Feulgen technique of staining and squashing, as described by COUCOLI & SYMEONm~S (1980) to determine the chromosome number. Proteins were extracted from bulked seeds by grinding mature seeds with cold (4 °C) distilled water over an ice bath. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 rain and the supernatant was lyophylized (MouSTAKAS ~: COUCOLI 1982) . The proteins thus obtained are probably largely albumins. The electrophoretic procedure was carried out by applying the isoelectric focusing method (MouSTAKAS ~: al. 1983) . A polyacrylamide gel containing 2.2% w/v carrier ampholite with pH range 4.0-6.0 was used. Three gel replications were used to verify the reproducibility of the results and thus each extract was run an average of 8 times. The electrophoretic phenotypes obtained from the six taxa of the present study showed a striking degree of similarity. From Fig. 1 it can be observed that the patterns of A. bessarabicum, A. rechingeri, A. junceiforme, A. elongatum, A. flaccidifolium, and A. seirpeum had the same 40pI bands. No qualitative protein phenotypic differences were found. Some quantitative differences were recognized as expected. Interpopulational and intrapopulational variation was checked by previously selecting A. bessarabicum as a representative taxon and examining proteins from the seeds of individual plants of 5 populations. In most populations 6-10 plants were studied. In all instances no qualitative differences were detected (MousTAKAS & COUCOLI 1982) . The most conspicuous intensity differences in the patterns of the six taxa mostly concern the bands between 8 and 22. That is, bands 9, 15, and 16 were the most intense in the profile of the diploid A. bessarabicum. Bands 9, 14, 16, and 17 showed a higher degree of intensity in A. junceiforme, while bands 9, 10, 13, and 14 were more intense in A. rechingeri. In A. elongatum the most intense bands were 8, 16, 18, and 35. Finally, bands 9, 17, 18, 21, 22, 27 , and 35 showed higher intensity in A. scirpeum while bands 14 and 16 were more intense in A. flaccidifolium. The occurrence of the same pI bands in diploid and polyploid taxa indicate an autopolyploid origin of the polyploids as has been mentioned by SYMEONIDIS al. (1985) . According to LADIZINSKY & HYMOWITZ (1979) the difference in darkness of bands in seed protein profiles suggest that the formation of these bands is probably under the control of quantitative gene systems. From their cytological analyses, HZNZEN & RUNEMARK (1972a) and MOUS-TAKAS & COLrCOLI (1982) conclude that the seven pairs of A. bessarabicurn show a striking similarity in chromosome size and position of centromeres with the seven largest pairs in tetraploid A. rechingeri and A. junceiforrne. Furthermore, the karyotype of the diploid A. bessarabicum is very similar to the karyotype of the diploid A. elongatum ( (EVANS 1962 , HENEEN & RUNEMARK 1972a , b, MOUSTAKAS & COUCOLI 1982 , WANG 1985 , HSIAO & al. 1986 . WANG (1985) successfully crossed A. bessarabicum with A. elongatum, while ENDO & GILL (1984) found a distinction between the two species in C-banding patterns. However, WANG (1985) concluded that the interspecific hybrids that were capable of homologous pairing outweigh the C-banding differences. We believe, in agreement with HSIAO & al. (1986) , that the C-banding differences of the two taxa are due to structural rearrangements. At first evaluation, our protein patterns tend to support the hypothesis that in the examined taxa of the A. junceum and the A. elongatum complex there exists only one genome, so that the polyploids should be considered as autopolyploids. However, from the cytological information (H~NEEN 1962 , 1977 , BRETON-SlNTES & CAUDERON 1978 , chromosomal rearrangements must have taken place in most of the taxa. Such rearrangements obviously play an important role in speciation (STEBBINS 1971 , AVISE 1976 , NAGL 1978 and may cause rapid evolution (FERNANDEZ- PER-ALTA & al. 1983) . Allopolyploidy has played an important role in the evolution of higher plants, whereas strict autopolyploidy is considered as a rather uncommon phenomenon (STEBBINS 1971) . Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed some species which must be considered as autopolyploids (GONZALEZ-AGUILERA & FERNANDEZ-PER-ALTA 1983). Such polyploids with time can undergo further genetic changes and chromosome differentiation , MOUSTAKAS & al. 1986 . Such a situation might have taken place in most of the examined polyploids of the A. junceum and the A. elongatum complexes. Taking into consideration the close relationship between the genomes J and E (CAuDERON 1966 (CAuDERON , 1979 , the ability of their corresponding chromosomes to pair with each other (WANG 1985) , and our results of seed protein electrophoresis, we consider the J and E genomes as variations of the same genome. Moreover, we think that the two polyploid complexes must be placed in the genus Thinopyrurn as was proposed by DEWEY (1984) . Thinopyrum is a genus erected recently by LOvE (1980) who included in it only  . : z z z : : . -2 -~5 F . DEWEY (1984) expanded the genus to about 20 species from Thinopyrum, Lophopyrum and part of Elytrigia. Thinopyrum sensu LOVE consists of species based on the J genome while Lophopyrum sensu LOVE is a genus of about 20 species with L. elongatum as the type species and the E genome as the basic genome (LOVE 1982) . DVORAK (1981) and McGUIRE (1984) favour combining the J and E genome designations under the letter E. We have decided to retain the designation J for both genomes, because it is the older. The genome designations of the six Thinopyrum taxa given in Table 1 are based on cytological information and the seed protein patterns of the present study combined with information provided by other workers, jh and Jel stand for the same but structurally differentiated genome. Our results of seed protein electrophoresis confirm the stability of seed protein profiles and support the statement that intrinsic changes in plants such as chromosomal rearrangements or even doubling of the chromosome number have no effects on the seed storage protein patterns and the structural genes responsible for their coding (LADIZINSKY • HYMOWITZ 1979 , MOUSTAKAS & al. 1983 , 1986 .

In the present study isoelectric focusing was selected among the electrophoretic techniques since it affords the highest resolution. Recently, two classification systems of Tritieeae slightly differing from each other and both based on genomic relationships were published (LOVE 1984 , DEWEY 1984 . The taxa of the two complexes were placed in the same genus (Thinopyrum) by DEWEY (1984) but in two different genera (Thinopyrum and Lophopyrum) by LOvE (1984) . The sources of the seed materials examined cytologically and subjected to electrophoresis are as follows: Agropyron bessarabicum: Greece: Euboea, littoral zone; A. rechingeri: Greece: Naxos, in schistose littoral rocks; A. flaccidifolium: Greece: Naxos. The seeds of all three above mentioned taxa were collected by MOUSTAKAS & SYMEONIDIS and the voucher specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Thessaloniki (TAU). A. elongatum: cultivated at Versailles; A. junceiforme: French Atlantic coast; A. scirpeum: . Italian coast; seeds of these three taxa were kindly made available by Y. CAUDERON; voucher specimens are deposited at I.N.R.A. Versailles, France. All materials, before being subjected to electrophoresis, were examined cytologically with the usual Feulgen technique of staining and squashing, as described by COUCOLI & SYMEONm~S (1980) to determine the chromosome number. Proteins were extracted from bulked seeds by grinding mature seeds with cold (4 °C) distilled water over an ice bath. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 rain and the supernatant was lyophylized (MouSTAKAS ~: COUCOLI 1982) . The proteins thus obtained are probably largely albumins. The electrophoretic procedure was carried out by applying the isoelectric focusing method (MouSTAKAS ~: al. 1983) . A polyacrylamide gel containing 2.2% w/v carrier ampholite with pH range 4.0-6.0 was used. Three gel replications were used to verify the reproducibility of the results and thus each extract was run an average of 8 times. The electrophoretic phenotypes obtained from the six taxa of the present study showed a striking degree of similarity. From Fig. 1 it can be observed that the patterns of A. bessarabicum, A. rechingeri, A. junceiforme, A. elongatum, A. flaccidifolium, and A. seirpeum had the same 40pI bands. No qualitative protein phenotypic differences were found. Some quantitative differences were recognized as expected. Interpopulational and intrapopulational variation was checked by previously selecting A. bessarabicum as a representative taxon and examining proteins from the seeds of individual plants of 5 populations. In most populations 6-10 plants were studied. In all instances no qualitative differences were detected (MousTAKAS & COUCOLI 1982) . The most conspicuous intensity differences in the patterns of the six taxa mostly concern the bands between 8 and 22. That is, bands 9, 15, and 16 were the most intense in the profile of the diploid A. bessarabicum. Bands 9, 14, 16, and 17 showed a higher degree of intensity in A. junceiforme, while bands 9, 10, 13, and 14 were more intense in A. rechingeri. In A. elongatum the most intense bands were 8, 16, 18, and 35. Finally, bands 9, 17, 18, 21, 22, 27 , and 35 showed higher intensity in A. scirpeum while bands 14 and 16 were more intense in A. flaccidifolium. The occurrence of the same pI bands in diploid and polyploid taxa indicate an autopolyploid origin of the polyploids as has been mentioned by SYMEONIDIS al. (1985) . According to LADIZINSKY & HYMOWITZ (1979) the difference in darkness of bands in seed protein profiles suggest that the formation of these bands is probably under the control of quantitative gene systems. From their cytological analyses, HZNZEN & RUNEMARK (1972a) and MOUS-TAKAS & COLrCOLI (1982) conclude that the seven pairs of A. bessarabicurn show a striking similarity in chromosome size and position of centromeres with the seven largest pairs in tetraploid A. rechingeri and A. junceiforrne. Furthermore, the karyotype of the diploid A. bessarabicum is very similar to the karyotype of the diploid A. elongatum ( (EVANS 1962 , HENEEN & RUNEMARK 1972a , b, MOUSTAKAS & COUCOLI 1982 , WANG 1985 , HSIAO & al. 1986 . WANG (1985) successfully crossed A. bessarabicum with A. elongatum, while ENDO & GILL (1984) found a distinction between the two species in C-banding patterns. However, WANG (1985) concluded that the interspecific hybrids that were capable of homologous pairing outweigh the C-banding differences. We believe, in agreement with HSIAO & al. (1986) , that the C-banding differences of the two taxa are due to structural rearrangements. At first evaluation, our protein patterns tend to support the hypothesis that in the examined taxa of the A. junceum and the A. elongatum complex there exists only one genome, so that the polyploids should be considered as autopolyploids. However, from the cytological information (H~NEEN 1962 , 1977 , BRETON-SlNTES & CAUDERON 1978 , chromosomal rearrangements must have taken place in most of the taxa. Such rearrangements obviously play an important role in speciation (STEBBINS 1971 , AVISE 1976 , NAGL 1978 and may cause rapid evolution (FERNANDEZ- PER-ALTA & al. 1983) . Allopolyploidy has played an important role in the evolution of higher plants, whereas strict autopolyploidy is considered as a rather uncommon phenomenon (STEBBINS 1971) . Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed some species which must be considered as autopolyploids (GONZALEZ-AGUILERA & FERNANDEZ-PER-ALTA 1983). Such polyploids with time can undergo further genetic changes and chromosome differentiation , MOUSTAKAS & al. 1986 . Such a situation might have taken place in most of the examined polyploids of the A. junceum and the A. elongatum complexes. Taking into consideration the close relationship between the genomes J and E (CAuDERON 1966 (CAuDERON , 1979 , the ability of their corresponding chromosomes to pair with each other (WANG 1985) , and our results of seed protein electrophoresis, we consider the J and E genomes as variations of the same genome. Moreover, we think that the two polyploid complexes must be placed in the genus Thinopyrurn as was proposed by DEWEY (1984) . Thinopyrum is a genus erected recently by LOvE (1980) who included in it only  . : z z z : : . -2 -~5 F . DEWEY (1984) expanded the genus to about 20 species from Thinopyrum, Lophopyrum and part of Elytrigia. Thinopyrum sensu LOVE consists of species based on the J genome while Lophopyrum sensu LOVE is a genus of about 20 species with L. elongatum as the type species and the E genome as the basic genome (LOVE 1982) . DVORAK (1981) and McGUIRE (1984) favour combining the J and E genome designations under the letter E. We have decided to retain the designation J for both genomes, because it is the older. The genome designations of the six Thinopyrum taxa given in Table 1 are based on cytological information and the seed protein patterns of the present study combined with information provided by other workers, jh and Jel stand for the same but structurally differentiated genome. Our results of seed protein electrophoresis confirm the stability of seed protein profiles and support the statement that intrinsic changes in plants such as chromosomal rearrangements or even doubling of the chromosome number have no effects on the seed storage protein patterns and the structural genes responsible for their coding (LADIZINSKY • HYMOWITZ 1979 , MOUSTAKAS & al. 1983 , 1986 .

('lyrata', "Breeding system of the annual Cruciferae, Arabidopsis kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana . The breeding system of an annual Cruciferae, Arabidopsis kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana, was studied in three natural populations. We applied four experimental treatments, open pollination, bagging, emasculation + bagging, and emasculation + hand-pollination + bagging. None of the emasculated flowers with bags produced fruits but we observed high fruit sets in the other three treatments. The results confirmed that A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana is a self-compatible, non-apomictic species that can produce seeds through auto-pollination. Considering the life cycle as an annual, increased reproductive assurance through auto-pollination should be critical for the maintenance of populations of A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana. Breeding systems of the genus Arabidopsis have been studied especially in relation to self-incompatibility (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1995; Charlesworth et al. 2000 Charlesworth et al. , 2003a Shimizu et al. 2004; Mable et al. 2005 ). Although the model species A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. is selfcompatible (Jones 1971) , it is considered to have evolved from a self-incompatible ancestor (Shimizu et al. 2004) . The loss of self-incompatibility is considered to enhance reproductive assurance, which is critical especially for annual species (Shimizu et al. 2004) . Although the breeding systems of wild Arabidopsis species have recently attracted the attention of plant evolutionary biologists, life history studies in natural populations are still limited (Clauss and Koch 2006) . Arabidopsis kamchatica (Fisch. ex DC.) K. Shimizu & Kudoh subsp. kawasakiana (Makino) K. Shimizu & Kudoh grows on sandy sea/lake shores of western Honshu, Japan. Most of the plants in natural populations express phenology as winter annuals, and germinate in autumn and flower in March-June (Sugisaka and Kudoh, unpublished) . The objective of the work discussed in this paper was to evaluate the breeding system of A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana in natural populations. Mable et al. (2004) suggested that the subspecies is self-compatible, based on the observation that three successive generations of plants grown in a green house produced viable seeds through selfing. No observations on the breeding systems from natural populations have been reported. In this study, we report levels of fruit set in natural populations, and the results of field experiments that combined emasculation, hand-pollination, and bagging treatments. Arabidopsis kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana was originally described as Arabis kawasakiana Makino (Makino 1913) , and became treated as a subspecies of Arabis lyrata L. Murata 1961, 1962) because of their morphological similarities. O'Kane and Al-Shehbaz (1997) treated Arabis kawasakiana as a synonym of Arabidopsis lyrata (L.) O'Kane & Al-Shehbaz subsp. kamchatica (Fisch. ex DC.) O'Kane & Al-Shehbaz, a tetraploid taxon (2n = 4x = 32, Dart et al. 2004) . Recent study of bivalent meiotic chromosome counts and the nuclear gene sequence revealed that the tetraploid has allotetraploid origin between A. lyrata and A. halleri (L.) O'Kane & Al-Shehbaz subsp. gemmifera (Matum.) O'Kane and Al-Shehbaz, and Arabis kawasakiana is now treated as A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana (Shimizu et al. 2005) . The species is endangered (Environment Agency of Japan 2000); extant populations occur in the Toyama, Shiga, Mie, and Kochi Prefectures. The study was conducted in three natural populations that were selected from the northern, central, and southern parts of the geographic distribution of the subspecies (Table 1) . The Hamakurosaki site (Toyama-shi, Toyama Prefecture) is located in a sandy open habitat along the coast of Toyama Bay. The Nakashohama site (Takashimashi, Shiga Prefecture) is on the western shore of Lake Biwa, the largest fresh-water lake in Japan. The Fukiiura site (Matsusaka-shi, Mie Prefecture) is a sandy open site in a coastal pine forest of Ise Bay. At the Hamakurosaki, Nakashohama, and Fukiiura sites, 56, 204, and 36 plants, respectively, were used in the experiments. Four neighboring plants were assigned as a set, and each set was more than 2 m from other sets; we designated 14, 51, and 9 sets, respectively, at the three sites. The sample sizes were determined by the number of flowering individuals on each site. Each of the following four treatments was randomly applied to one of the plants in a set. For each plant, we selected a flower bud that would open in the next day and marked it by a string tied to a peduncle. In the open pollination treatment the flower buds were untouched and flowers were open to pollinators. We considered that the fruit sets in the open-pollination treatments represented those observed under natural conditions, and the results from this treatment served as controls with which other treatments were compared statistically. In the bagging treatment, each flower bud was covered with a small plastic bag to prevent pollinators from visiting the flower. Bags had tiny holes for ventilation. We expected high fruit set in the bagging treatment if the plants produce seed either by apomixis or by auto-pollination. In the emasculation + bagging treatment, anthers were removed from the flower buds before flowering. For emasculation, we removed sepals and petals from the flower buds. The flowers were bagged immediately after the emasculation. If we see no fruit set in this treatment, it suggests the flowers require pollen to set fruit, so we can then exclude apomictic seed reproduction from the list of possible breeding systems. In the emasculation + hand-pollination + bagging treatments, stigmas of each emasculated flower were handpollinated using pollen grains from a single flower on a plant over 5 m from the treated plant. We set this treatment as a second control to evaluate our experimental procedures. High fruit set in this treatment would suggest that the damage caused by bagging and emasculation were not preventing fruit set. The experimental treatments were applied on 10 May, 16-17 April and 18-19 May, and 18 April 2003 for the Hamakurosaki, Nakashohama, and Fukiiura sites, respectively. Bags on the flowers were removed 4-7 days after anthesis so the bags did not interfere with fruit development. We recorded the number of flowers that developed fruits ca. 4 weeks after the treatments. Fruit set was calculated as the proportion of flowers that produced fruits for each treatment within each site. Fruit set in the bagging, emasculation + bagging, and emasculation + hand-pollination + bagging treatments were compared with that in the open-pollination treatment using the v 2 test (Sokal and Rohlf 1995) . In these tests, we kept the total error rate a = 0.05 and 0.01 by the sequential Bonferoni methods (Rice 1989; Sokal and Rohlf 1995) . We also observed pollinators at the three sites during the time we conducted the experimental treatments. In the open-pollination treatment we observed high fruit set (0.89-0.98) at all three sites ( Table 2 ). All of the bagged flowers developed fruits and there were no statistical differences between the bagging and the open-pollination treatments at the three sites ( Table 2) . None of the emasculated flowers produced fruits and differences from the open-pollination treatment were highly significant at all three sites (Table 2) . The emasculation + hand-pollination + bagging treatment resulted in high fruit set (0.86-1.00), and no statistical difference was detected between this and the open-pollination treatment at all the sites (Table 2) . During the experiments flowers at the most southern site, Fukiiura, were often visited by a small Coleoptera, Oedemeronia lucidicollis Motschulsky. However, we observed few pollinators visiting flowers at the Hamakurosaki and Nakashohama sites. The results indicate that A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana is a self-compatible, non-apomictic species that is able to produce seeds by auto-pollination. High fruit set in the emasculation + hand-pollination + bagging treatment confirmed that our emasculation and bagging treatments did not interfere with fruit development. Zero fruit set in the emasculation + bagging treatment and high fruit sets in the emasculation + hand-pollination + bagging treatment strongly indicated the flowers required fertilization by pollen gains to develop fruits. High fruit set in the bagging treatment suggested that the flowers are self-compatible and have a mechanism for auto-pollination. The results were more or less similar across the three sites chosen to cover the geographical range of the subspecies. Considering the life history of A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana as an annual, increased reproductive assurance through auto-pollination should be critical to producing seeds when pollinator densities are low, conditions that were observed in the two northern populations in our study. The subspecies occurs on sandy sea/ lake shores exposed to direct sunlight and the ground surface temperature often reaches beyond 50°C in daytime during summer. This extremely high summer temperature does not allow plants to maintain perennial rosettes and only seeds can survive the summer. Our results do not necessarily indicate that outcrossing is absent or minor in the natural populations. Indeed, in the most southern population, flowers were often visited by a Colleopteran pollinator and outcrossing might be frequent under conditions with high pollinator densities. Shimizu et al. (2005) reported that A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana has an allotetraploid (2n = 32) origin between two diploid taxa (2n = 16), A. lyrata and A. halleri subsp. gemmifera. Both parental species are known to be self-incompatible perennials (Jonsell et al. 1995; Schierup 1998; Mable et al. 2004) . These facts and our results indicate that self-incompatibility broke down during the evolutionary process of A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana. Besides A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana, A. suecica (Fr.) Norrl. ex O.E.Schulz is a self-compatible allotetraploid (2n = 26) between A. thaliana (2n = 10) and A. arenosa (L.) Lawalree (2n = 16) (Säll et al. 2003) . Tetraploid A. arenosa (2n = 32), a putative autotetraploid, is reported to be self-incompatible (Säll et al. 2004) . Tetraploid populations of A. lyrata subsp. petraea (L.) O'Kane & Al-Shehbaz from Austria are strongly self-incompatible but their allo/autopolyploid origins are unknown (Mable et al. 2004) . Mable et al. (2005) found that North American populations of A. lyrata subsp. lyrata included self-compatible individuals. In a recent review in which an association between ploidy levels and self-compatibilities were examined using a large database, Mable (2004) found that polyploidy did not necessarily associate with selfcompatibility. More information on breeding systems in populations of Arabidopsis species is obviously required before we can correlate polyploidy and loss of selfincompatibility. An interesting question to be asked in future studies is whether the breakdown of self-incompatibility in A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana occurred as a direct result of allopolyploidization or whether it occurred along with evolution of the life cycle as an annual.

('speltoides', "Supernumerary chromosomes in the second outbreeding species of the wheat group . Meiosis was examined in PMC of 138 plants of the outbreeder Triticum speltoides (=Aegilops speltoides) and 175 plants of the closely related T. longissimum (= Ae. longissima), which is a selfer. Nine of the T. speltoides plants, originating fra two of the five Israeli populations under study, contained B chromosomes in addition to the normal complements (2n = 14). No supernumerary chromosomes were found in T. longissimum. — Plants were found carrying 1, 2 or 3 B chromosomes, which seem to be stable among PMC. Their size is 2/3 of the average length of the regular chromosomes, but otherwise they are similar in appearance. Pairing between Bs is common as bivalents and trivalents, but whether this association is ehiasmatic is not clear. There is a slight reduction in chiasma frequency of the regular complement in B-carriers compared to other plants from the same population. — The only other species in the wheat group reported to have B chromosomes in natural populations is also an outbreeder, namely T. tripsacoides (=Ae. mutica). The connection between outbreeding and B chromosomes might be significant. Most of the wheat species and their close relatives (the Triticum-Aegilops group~Zohary, 1966; Morris and Sears, 1967) are selfers. The only two exceptions are Triticum speltoides (----Aegilops speltoides) and Triticum tripsacoides (~ A egilops mutica), which are clearly outbreeders. The peculiar breeding behaviour of these two species is evident from the following. Firstly, the anthers open and discharge the pollen after they are released from the flowers, while in other species of the group the discharge of poller, takes place inside the flowers. Secondly, T. speltoides and T. tripsacoides give a lower seed set upon bagging (selling) than their relatives. Thirdly, progeny of single plants of these two species commonly show segregation of various polymorphic traits, resulting from a high level of heterozygosity as well as from fertilisation by pollen from other plants. In T. speltoides such segregation could be observed among progeny of plants homozygous for a naturally occurring recessive marker (the speltoides-ligustica difference) and the rate of outbreeding was estimated around 80 percent (Zohary and Imber, 1963) . So far, the only species in the wheat group in which supernumerary chromosomes (B chromosomes) have been reported to occur in natural populations has been T. tripsacoides (Mochizuki, 1957 (Mochizuki, , 1960 . Originally See Material and Methods for details; the first sib arrangement represents one family of 3 plants, 7 families of 2 plants each and one family of a single plant. b Unless otherwise stated these plants were grown from seed collected in the wild. these supernumerary chromosomes were found in interspecific hybrids involving a particular plant of this species; later they were discovered in a sample of plants grown from seed collected in Turkey. In this note we report the occurrence of B-chromosomes in natural populations of the second outbreeder of the group, namely, T. speltoides. The cytological examinations were carried out on plants grown in 1969-1970 in an experimental field in Jerusalem. The field contained several thousand plants and was part of a study of the genetic structure of natural populations of T. speltoides and T. longissimum (= Ae. longissima). Five Israeli populations of the former and seven of the latter were each represented in the experiment by (1) plants grown from seed collected in the wild, (2) plants grown from seed obtained from selling, and (3) plants grown from seed obtained in a crossing programme among members of the same population. The seed from which (2) and (3) were grown were produced in Jerusalem in 1968-1969. All plants were randomized. More than 300 plants of the two species were chosen for cytological examination of meiosis. Anthers containing pollen mother cells (PMC) at metaphase I were fixed in 1:3 glacial acetic acid/absolute ethanol and transferred to 70% ethanolafteraday or two. On a few occasions anthers at other stages of meiosis were also fixed. Pollen mother cells were stained in aceto-carmine and spread for observation. The main purpose of the cytological study was to determine the frequency of chiasmata and therefore at least ten cells at metaphase I were closely examined. The chiasmaat study will be reported separately. Sampling of plants for cytological examination was random, with the restriction that families were chosen rather than single plants (see Table 1 ). Each family ehould have been represented by two siblings originating from the same spike (and there-fore having a common mother). In some cases plants were missing, hence these families were represented in the sample only by single plants (e.g. family 09-03 in Table 2 ). In one case, namely family 08-07 (see Table 2 ), the B chromosomes were discovered before fixation. Material from ~ third sibling of this family was consequently taken. This is the only clear deviation from random sampling in our study. One hundred and thirty-eight plants of T. speltoide8 were examined, of which 9 contaiJaed B chromosomes. These nine plants came from populations 08 and 09 (see Table 1 ). The frequency of B-carriers in population 08 is particularly high. The samples are not large enough to exclude the possible occurrence of B chromosomes in the three populations 10, 11 and 12. In fact, after the B-carriers were found in populations 08 and 09 we were informed by Dr. Moshe Feldman that in 1963 he had observed B chromosomes in two T. speltoides plants grown from seed collected near Ashkelon. The site of collection of his material was apparently very close to our site of population 12. Nevertheless, our sample did not reveal any supernumerary chromosomes. This might be due to a difference of a few hundred meters in collection sites, to a difference in 6-7 years in collection time, or due to sampling and chance alone. One hundred and seventy-five plants of T. longissimum were also examined at meiosis but none of these contained supernumerary ehromosonqes. Table 2 contains the famihal relationships between the plants that were found to carry B chromosomes. In population 08 the seven plants with B chromosomes belong to three families--two families of two sibs and one of three. These three families are not represented in our sample by any other plant, except the B-carriers. In population 09, on the other hand, the two plants containing B chromosomes belong to two different families, one of which (09-09) is represented in our sample by another plant that does not have Bs. Three of the families are heterogeneous with regard to the number of supernumerary chromosomes the sibs carry. The heterogeneity within families might be a result of the way supernumerary chromosomes are transmitted to the egg cells, as well as an outcome of heterogeneity in the fertilising pollen. As both factors are unknown at present we should not like to draw any conclusions from this heterogeneity. Another chromosomal peculiarity was found in populations 08 and 09, namely, that of translocation heterozygotes. In population 08 one of the B-carriers, plant 264, was heterozygous in respect of a reciprocal translocation and showed the typical quadrivalent configuration in most meiotic cells examined (see Fig. 3 ). In population 09, two plants were transloeation heterozygotes, one of which was a sibling of a B-carrier (plant 1364 in Table 2 ). There seems to be no simple explanation for a possible connection between the B chromosomes and the reciprocal translocations. A similar connection between the presence of B chromosomes and another type of chromosomal aberration (loss of chromosomes of the regular complement) is evident from the work of Rhoades et al. (1967) in maize. The size of the supernumerary chromosomes is similar in all our plants; they are about 2/3 of the size of the other chromosomes (see Figs. 1-7) . Morphologically the B chromosomes are similar to the regular complement. In meiotic preparations, from pachytene through the second division, they are not heteropycnotic nor do they show any other peculiar feature, except their smaller dimensions. In mitotic metaphase observed in anther preparation they seem submetacentric but smaller (Fig. 6) . At meiosis the B chromosomes tend to pair. In 2B-carriers they form bivalents (Fig. 5 ) and only rarely remain unpaired. In 3B-carriers they usually either form a bivalent and a univalent (Fig. 1) , or a trivalent (Figs. 2 and 4 ). The occurrence of 3 single, unpaired, B's is less common. The B-bivalents behave similarly to the other seven regular bivalents, being of either rod or ring shape. Whether the association is truly homologous and chiasmatic is difficult to say. Some rings of three B's were observed in diakinesis in 3B-carriers (Fig. 7) ; such a configuration argues against a homologous pairing, unless we assume that the two arms of at least one of them are homologous. The single B chromosomes behave as univalents: they are commonly late in moving to one of the Table 2 ) with three Bs. Fig. 3 . Plant 264 with one B and a quadrivalent (a reciprocal transloeation, marked T). Fig. 5 . Plant 1610 with two Bs forming a ring bivalent. Fig. 6 . Mitotic metaphase (anther preparation) in plant 450, showing 14 chromosomes of the regular complement and 3 Bs (the latter can be recognized only because they are smaller). Fig. 7 . Part of diakinesis in plant 450. The three B chromosomes form a ring configuration that may indicate nonhomologous pairing. The size of the Bs can be compared with the adjacent bivalents of the regular complement (n the nueleolus) . 1 All figures are o:F the same magnification. poles at anaphase I, and sometimes divide already at telophase I instead of in the second meiotic division. Pairing was never observed between the supernumerary chromosomes and members of the regular complement. Two additional characteristics of the B chromosomes in T. speltoides must be pointed out in the light of Mochizuki's (1957 Mochizuki's ( , 1960 findings in T. tripsacoides. First, he observed a marked instability of the B chromosomes while our data show the supernumeraries to be stable. We have only examined anthers, though in all B-carriers numerous anthers were used, sometimes from different spikes. Mochizuki, on the other hand, examined various other parts of the plants. Secondly, Moehiznki 1957reported a major disorder of meiosis in plants carrying a single B; pairing was very low and most chromosomes appeared as univalents in metaphase I and therefore meiosis could not proceed normally. We did not observe such an effect in T. speltoides, although a slight (but significant) reduction in the ehiasma frequency of the normal complement was observed : In population 08 the eleven plants not carrying B chromosomes had an average of 13.50 chiasmata per cell in metaphase I as compared with 12.67 in the seven B-carriers. Influence of B chromosomes on the frequency of ehiasmata is known from other instances (for instance, Jones and Rees, 1967; ZeSevi5 and Paunovid, 1969; Cameron and Rees, 1967; Ayonoadu and Rees, 1968; John and Hewitt, 1965a, b) and the comparable analysis in T. speltoides will be reported in detail separately. We have seen that T. speltoides and T. tripsacoides are unique in the wheat group in being outbreeders and in showing polymorphism for B chromosomes in natural populations. These two characteristics seem to be related to each other. In fact, almost all instances of B chromosome polymorphism in plants have been reported in cross-pollinating species, for example Secale cereale (Mfintzing, 1954) , Lolium perenne (Cameron and Rees, 1967) and diploid Dactylis glomerata (Zohary and Ashkenazi, 1958) . It is possible that B chromosomes are somehow removed from the population through selling. On the other hand, there might be some positive role, and therefore selective advantage in having a supernumerary-chromosome system, which is conditioned by regular outbreeding. For the moment, we feel that the nature of the relationship between outbreeding and B chromosome polymorphism remains open and awaits further understanding of the biological effects and origin of these chromo-SOIIles. A third characteristic of T. speltoides and T. tripsacoides which distinguishes them among the diploid species of wheat is that they possess the suppressive allele of the diploidisation gene of wheat, the so-called 5B locus (Riley and Law, 1965) . Interspecific hybrids between most diploid species in the group and Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) . show a low degree of pairing between homoeologous chromosomes, while the hybrids between T. 8peltoides or T, tripsaeoides and T. aestivum . show a high degree of pairing. It is likely that the uniqueness of these two species in their effect on homoeologous pairing is related to their breeding behaviour. The role, if any, of the B chromosomes in this connection has not yet been studied in T. speltoides. Preliminary reports of interactions between the B chromosomes and the 5B effect in hybrids involving T. tripsaeoide8 have been published (Mochiznki, ]964). Chromosoma (Berl.), Bd. 33 . -7 a.

('multiflorus', 'Karyotypic features including organizations of the 5S, 45S rDNA loci and telomeres of Scadoxus multiflorus (Amaryllidaceae) . Abstract Scadoxus multiflorus Martyn, 1795 is an ornamental plant with brilliantly colored flowers. Even though its chromosomes are rather large, there is no karyotype description reported so far. Therefore, conventional and molecular cytogenetic studies including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 45S and 5S rDNA, and human telomere sequence (TTAGGG)n probes (Arabidopsis-type telomere probes yielded negative results) were carried out. The chromosome number is as reported previously, 2n = 18. The nine chromosome pairs include two large submetacentric, five large acrocentric, one medium acrocentric, two small metacentric and eight small submetacentric chromosomes. Hybridization sites of the 45S rDNA signals were on the short arm ends of chromosomes #1, #3 and #8, while 5S rDNA signals appeared on the long arm of chromosome 3, in one homologue as a double signal. The telomere signals were restricted to all chromosome ends. Three chromosome pairs could be newly identified, chromosome pair 3 by 5S rDNA and chromosomes #1, #3 and #8 by 45S rDNA loci. In addition to new information about rDNA locations we show that the ends of Scadoxus multiflorus chromosomes harbor human instead of Arabidopsis-type telomere sequences. Overall, the Scadoxus multiflorus karyotype presents chromosomal heteromorphy concerning size, shape and 45S and 5S rDNA positioning. As Scadoxus Rafinesque, 1838 and related species are poorly studied on chromosomal level the here presented data is important for better understanding of evolution in Amaryllidaceae. Scadoxus multiflorus Martyn, 1795 (also known as Haemanthus multiflorus Martyn, 1795 and H. kalbreyeri Baker, 1878 ) is a species belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae (Chase et al. 2009) , which can naturally only be found in Southern and tropical Africa (Patwary and Zaman 1980) . Formerly, the genus Scadoxus Rafinesque, 1838 was Haemanthus Linnaeus, 1753 and was included in the family Liliaceae (Ahirwar and Verma 2014) ; however, it is not included in the current circumscription of this family (Peruzzi 2016) , and was indeed separated out and relocated by Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG IV) classification system. Scadoxus multiflorus is economically important as it is popular as cultivated ornamental plant. Nonetheless, this species was not studied yet for its karyotype in details. There are only two previous reports based on conventional chromosome staining of S. multiflorus. Both studies reported 2n = 18 chromosomes, however, Ahirwar and Verma (2014) found six submetacentric and 12 acrocentric chromosomes while Patwary and Zaman (1980) reported one metacentric, nine submetacentric, six acrocentric and two telocentric chromosomes. Besides these contradictory data, molecular cytogenetic approaches like florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have not been applied in this species yet. Such methods being available since the late 1980s (Li et al. 2016 , Taguchi et al. 2016 ) enable detection, characterization and localization of rDNA regions (Chirino et al. 2015) and/or telomeres. The latter are known to be important to protect chromosomal ends of all eukaryotes against nucleolytic degradation, non-homologous end-joining and replication-mediated shortening. They usually consist of short tandem repeats, such as (TTTAGGG) n in Arabidopsis Heynhold, 1842 (Richards and Ausubel 1988) or (TTAGGG) n in humans (Moyzis et al. 1988 ). The Arabidopsis G-rich telomere repeat is rather conserved and has been detected at the ends of most chromosomes of higher plants examined so far. Nevertheless, in some plants the TTTAGGG-type telomere repeat is lacking and substituted by other repeat sequences (Fajkus et al. 2016) . As for S. multiflorus reported karyotypic details are contradictory and no FISH studies have been performed so far the present study aimed to close this gap of knowledge using conventional staining and FISH. Scadoxus multiflorus plant was collected in Khon Kaen Province, Northeastern, Thailand (A. Chaveerach et al. 903, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen Univer-sity, Khon Kaen, Thailand). The roots were collected from bulbs placed in distilled water at room temperature. The root tips were excised and kept in cold water for 1 h at 4°C, after that transferred to 0.05% colchicine solution for 4 h at room temperature to accumulate metaphase chromosomes before fixation in ethanol:acetic acid (3:1, v/v) for at least 24 h at 4°C. The protocol for the SteamDrop method (Kirov et al. 2014 ) was adopted with a few modifications. Briefly, fixed root tips were washed twice with enzyme buffer (0.01 M citric acid, 0.01 M sodium citrate, pH 4.7) to remove the fixative and digested at 37°C for 4 h in enzyme solution consisting of 0.7% cellulase R10 (Duchefa C8001), 0.7% cellulase (CalBioChem 319466), 1% pectolyase (Sigma P3026) and 1% cytohelicase (Sigma C8274) in enzyme buffer. Then, the soft meristematic tissues were washed twice with distilled water and 96% ethanol to remove supernatant with centrifuge before broken with a dissecting needle in a tube in fixative. The suspension was dropped on a glass slide and air dried. Preparations with well spread metaphases were selected for further analyses. Conventional staining was carried out on slides using 2% aceto-orcein for 5 min at room temperature and then covered with a coverslip. Ten well-spread metaphases were selected for photomicrography with a digital camera under oil immersion by light microscope. The length of short and long chromosome arms (p and q) were measured separately and added to calculate the total length (LT). The relative length of chromosome (RL), the centromeric index (CI) and standard deviation (SD) of RL and CI were calculated according to Chaiyasut (1989) . The CI (q/p+q) between 0.500-0.599, 0.600-0.699, 0.700-0.899 and 0.900-0.999 were considered as metacentric (m), submetacentric (sm), acrocentric (a) and telocentric (t), respectively, following Turpin and Lejeune (1965) to classify the types of chromosome. These parameters were used for idiograming by computer. Comparison of different estimators of intrachromosomal asymmetry was performed, including mean centromeric asymmetry (M CA ) and coefficient of variation of chromosome length (CV CL ) based on the equations provided by Peruzzi and Eroğlu (2013) . Metaphase chromosomes from overall 10 cells were included. 45S and 5S rDNAs which were isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana Schur, 1866 and telomere repeat sequences from Arabidopsis (TTTAGGG) n and human (TTAGGG) n were applied in this study. The plasmid of 45S rDNA cloned in the vector T 15 P 10 IV 1 was labelled with Alexa 488-dUTP, while the 5S rDNA probe was labelled with Cy3-dUTP by Nick translation (Roche Cat No 11745808910). The telomeric probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in absence of a DNA template using primers (TTTAGGG) 5 and (CCCTAAA) 5 , and (TTAGGG) 5 and (CCCTAA) 5 according to Ijdo et al. (1991) and labelled with Cy3-dUTP by nick translation. A FISH protocol according to Lysak et al. (2006) was applied with minor modifications. The slide with fixed metaphase cells was washed in 2 × SSC (300 mM Na-citrate, 30 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) for 5 min at room temperature and treated with 45% acetic acid for 3 min. Then the slides were washed twice in 2 × SSC for 5 min each at room temperature before digestion in pepsin solution (10 mg/ml) in 0.01 M HCl for 1 min at 37°C, rinsing twice in 2 × SSC for 5 min, post-fixation in 4% formaldehyde in 2 × SSC for 5 min at room temperature, and two washes in 2 × SSC, with final dehydration in an ethanol series (70%, 90%, 100%) for 2 min, each, at room temperature and air drying. A 3 µl (60 ng) of labelled probe was dissolved in 17 µl of hybridization mixture (20% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide in 2 × SSC, pH 7.0), and pre-denatured at 95°C for 5 min. Then the solution was added to the slide, covered with a coverslip and sealed by rubber gum. Now, the slide was placed on a heating plate at 80°C for 2 min for co-denaturation of probe and target DNA and incubated in a moist chamber at 37°C for 18 h for hybridization. After hybridization, slides were washed in 2 × SSC for 5 min at 42°C and three times with 50% formamide in 2 × SSC for 5 min at 42°C. After that, slides were washed three times with 2 × SSC for 5 min at 42°C for 5 min each. Finally, the slides were dehydrated in an ethanol series, air dried, counterstained with 4, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) plus Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, USA) and covered with a coverslip. Signals were detected using an epifluorescence microscope with Triple filter (UV, Texas Red and FITC) and photographed (microscope: Axioplan2, Zeiss; Camera: Hammamatsu-ORCA-ER C4742-80, Japan; Lamp: Flouarc, Zeiss). The idiogram and karyotype analyses established from the metaphases confirmed the diploid chromosome number of S. multiflorus to be 2n = 18. The karyotype analysis of this species is summarized in Table 1 . The range of total arm length, centromeric index and relative chromosome length are 3.78-16.01 µm, 0.57-0.87 µm and 0.04-0.15 µm respectively. The karyotype comprises two large submetacentric, five large acrocentric, one medium acrocentric, two small metacentric and eight small submetacentric chromosomes (Fig. 1) . The plant shows a clear tendency to have karyotypes distinct on asymmetry grounds with relatively low M CA and CV CL as shown in Figure 2 and Table 2 . The metaphase spreads were hybridized with 45S (Alexa, green) and 5S (Cy3, red) rDNA probes as shown in Fig. 3 . The hybridization signals for the 45S rDNA probe are in terminal positions of the short arms of chromosomes #1, #3 and #8 (Fig. 3A) . The 5S rDNA signals were detected on the long arms of chromosome #3 with one homologue showing two adjacent signals (Figs. 3B-C) . Remarks: Chr. = chromosome pair, a = acrocentric, m = metacentric, sm = submetacentric, L = large, M = medium, S = small, a* and b* = heteromorphic pairs 1, 2, and 4. The hybridization of the Arabidopsis-type telomeric probe yielded no obvious FISH signal, while the human-type (Cy3, red) revealed small signals exclusively at the end of all S. multiflorus chromosomes (Fig. 4) . Overall, the results show chromosomal heteromorphy in sizes and shapes.  . Here we provide the first study of S. multiflorus chromosomes by means of molecular cytogenetics. Furthermore, the previously reported chromosome number could be confirmed to be 2n = 18 (Patwary and Zaman 1980, Ahirwar and Verma 2014) . However, here we report a karyotype variant in S. multiflorus as carrying two metacentric, ten submetacentric and six acrocentric chromosomes, which is in contradiction to what was previously reported by Patwary and Zaman (1980) or Ahirwar and Verma (2014) . This result indicates that further studies are necessary to clarify if there are either (i) cryptic (sub-)species in S. multiflorus, (ii) assessment problems in any of the previous studies, or (iii) any kind of chromosomal heteromorphisms leading to the observed different chromosomal shapes. Although the regions of 5S and 45S were not observed with conventional staining, due to several limitations, such as oil-immersion light microscopic methods, genetic processing and analysis standards, the signal intensities of rDNA probes in FISH showed clear variation in copy numbers. The copy number and distributed position on chromosome are very important as species markers (Boocock et al. 2015 , Li et al 2016 . In a group of families of the monocot order Asparagales, the telomeric sequence (TTAGGG) n of the human-type was found to be maintained (Sykorova et al. 2003) . Thus it is in accordance with the literature that S. multiflorus also has this type of telomeric repeat, as the family Amaryllidaceae belongs to this branch of Asparagales which switched from Arabidopsis-type to human type telomere sequence. The knowledge is the one factor supports the classification theory of a common ancestor for a plant group. Overall, our results allow now distinguishing five of the nine S. multiflorus chromosome pairs individually.

The basic number 7 for Filipendula is in agreement with the placing of this genus in the subfamily Rosoideae even though the hereditary peculiarities (apomixis and permanent chromosome hybridity) shown by some other members of this subfamily are apparently not now needed to explain the cytological situation in Filipendula.'), [{'full_name_matches': {'spiraea vulgaris', 'filipendula vulgaris', 'ulmaria vulgaris'}, 'sent_text': 'The results given in this paper show that x = 7 in this genus (compared with x = 9 in Spiraea) and the reasons for rejecting previous counts of 2n = 15 for F. vulgaris are presented.'}]

('pulchella', 'Ribosomal DNA distribution and a genus-wide phylogeny reveal patterns of chromosomal evolution in Alstroemeria (Alstroemeriaceae). PREMISE OF THE STUDY Understanding the flexibility of monocot genomes requires a phylogenetic framework, which so far is available for few of the ca. 2800 genera. Here we use a molecular tree for the South American genus Alstroemeria to place karyological information, including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) signals, in an explicit evolutionary context. METHODS From a phylogeny based on plastid, nuclear, and mitochondrial sequences for most species of Alstroemeria, we selected early-branching (Chilean) and derived (Brazilian) species for which we obtained 18S-25S and 5S rDNA FISH signals; we also analyzed chromosome numbers, 1C-values, and telomere FISH signals (in two species). KEY RESULTS Chromosome counts for Alstroemeria cf. rupestris and A. pulchella confirm 2n = 16 as typical of the genus, which now has chromosomes counted for 29 of its 78 species. The rDNA sites are polymorphic both among and within species, and interstitial telomeric sites in Alstroemeria cf. rupestris suggest chromosome fusion. CONCLUSIONS In spite of a constant chromosome number, closely related species of Alstroemeria differ drastically in their rDNA, indicating rapid increase, decrease, or translocations of these genes. Previously proposed Brazilian and Chilean karyotype groups are not natural, and the n = 8 chromosomes in Alstroemeria compared to n = 9 in its sister genus Bomarea may result from a Robertsonian fusion.'), [{'full_name_matches': {'bomarea pulchella', 'alstroemeria pulchella'}, 'sent_text': 'rupestris and A. pulchella confirm 2n = 16 as typical of the genus, which now has chromosomes counted for 29 of its 78 species.'}]

However, cytogenetic studies at metaphase I indicated univalents can be seen in a lateral view of the metaphase plate. Chromosome pairing and the number of univalents varied within and between the interspecific hybrids, with an average univalent number of 1.54 for the P. rollinsianum hybrids, 2.36 for the P. alpinum var. tetraneuris hybrids, and 2.46 for the P. alpinum var. alpinum hybrids. Pollen viability tests for the parental species and the hybrids were conducted by germination of pollen grains on stigmas. The percent of viable pollen recorded for the diploid guayule hybrids with P. rollinsianum, P. alpinum var. tetraneuris, and P. alpinum var. alpinum are 21.94, 13.47, and 1 1.17, respectively.

All taxa are diploid with 2n = 16 or 2n = 18 and show a variable degree of infraspecific variation, in particular in the polymorphic C. major and C. minor. Change in base number is associated with an early split between the two well-supported clades of C. major, corresponding to Cerinthe sect. Cerinthe, and that of all other taxa belonging to C. sect. Ceranthe, with the base x = 8 found only in the strictly annual C. major group, and x = 9 in the other five species of the genus: C. minor, C. glabra, C. tenuiflora, C. retorta and C. palaestina.
